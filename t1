    "question": "How does SpriteKit handle animations and what are actions used for?",
    "passages": [
      {
        "passage": "Create 2D sprite-based games using an optimized animation system, physics simulation, and event-handling support.\n- iOS 7.0+\n- macOS 10.9+\n- tvOS 9.0+\n- watchOS 3.0+\nSpriteKit is a graphics rendering and animation infrastructure that you can use to animate arbitrary textured images, otherwise known as sprites. SpriteKit provides a traditional rendering loop that alternates between determining the contents of and rendering frames. You determine the contents of the frame and how those contents change. SpriteKit does the work to render that frame efficiently using graphics hardware. SpriteKit is optimized for applying arbitrary animations or changes to your content. This design makes SpriteKit more suitable for games and apps that require flexibility in how animations are handled.\nSprite Content is Drawn by Presenting Scenes Inside a Sprite View\nAnimation and rendering is performed by an\nSKView object. You place this view inside a window, then render content to it. Because it is a view, its contents can be combined with other views in the view hierarchy.\nContent in your game is organized into scenes, which are represented by\nSKScene objects. A scene holds sprites and other content to be rendered. A scene also implements per-frame logic and content processing. At any given time, the view presents one scene. As long as a scene is presented, its animation and per-frame logic are automatically executed.\nTo create a game or app using SpriteKit, you either subclasses the\nSKScene class or create a scene delegate to perform major game-related tasks. For example, you might create separate scene classes to display a main menu, the gameplay screen, and content displayed after the game ends. You can easily use a single\nSKView object in your window and switch between different scenes. When you switch scenes, you can use the\nSKTransition class to animate between the two scenes.\nA Node Tree Defines What Appears in a Scene\nSKScene class is a descendant of the\nSKNode class. When using SpriteKit, nodes are the fundamental building blocks for all content, with the scene object acting as the root node for a tree of node objects. The scene and its descendants determine which content is drawn and how it is rendered.\nEach node\u2019s position is specified in the coordinate system defined by its parent. A node also applies other properties to its content and the content of its descendants.",

        "passage": "For example, when a node is rotated, all of its descendants are rotated also. You can build a complex image using a tree of nodes and then rotate, scale, and blend the entire image by adjusting the topmost node\u2019s properties.\nSKNode class does not draw anything, but it applies its properties to its descendants. Each kind of drawable content is represented by a distinct subclass in SpriteKit. Some other node subclasses do not draw content of their own, but modify the behavior of their descendants. For example, you can use an\nSKEffect object to apply a Core Image filter to an entire subtree in the scene. By precisely controlling the structure of the node tree, you determine the order in which nodes are rendered.\nAll node objects are responder objects, descending either from\nNSResponder, so you can subclass any node class and create new classes that accept user input. The view class automatically extends the responder chain to include the scene\u2019s node tree.\nSKNode reference for more information.\nTextures Hold Reusable Graphical Data\nTextures, represented as\nSKTexture objects, are shared images used to render sprites. Always use textures whenever you need to apply the same image to multiple sprites. Usually you create textures by loading image files stored in your app bundle. However, SpriteKit can also create textures for you at runtime from other sources, including Core Graphics images or even by rendering a node tree into a texture.\nSpriteKit simplifies texture management by handling the lower-level code required to load textures and make them available to the graphics hardware. Texture management is automatically managed by SpriteKit. However, if your game uses a large number of images, you can improve its performance by taking control of parts of the process. Primarily, you do this by telling SpriteKit explicitly to load a texture.\nA texture atlas is a group of related textures that are used together in your game. For example, you might use a texture atlas to store all of the textures needed to animate a character or all of the tiles needed to render the background of a gameplay level. SpriteKit uses texture atlases to improve rendering performance.\nNodes Execute Actions to Animate Content\nA scene\u2019s contents are animated using actions. Every action is an object, defined by the\nSKAction class. You tell nodes to execute actions. Then, when the scene processes frames of animation, the actions are executed.",

        "passage": "It is often useful to sequence many actions together to save code; for example, in order to give the unit portriats a bit of a jump back, I use the following code:\nleftSprite.position = ccp(-leftSprite.contentSize.width / 2,\nleftSprite.contentSize.height / 2);\nCCDelayTime *delay = [CCDelayTime actionWithDuration:leftDelay];\nCCMoveTo *move1 = [CCMoveTo actionWithDuration:0.23f position:ccp(leftSprite.contentSize.width / 2, leftSprite.contentSize.height / 2)];\nCCMoveTo *move2 = [CCMoveTo actionWithDuration:0.02f position:ccp(leftSprite.contentSize.width / 2 - 5, leftSprite.contentSize.height / 2)];\n[leftSprite runAction:[CCSequence actions:delay, move1, move2, nil]];\n(leftDelay is a value I use to control which of the sprites appears first).\nTake note of two things; first, the CCDelayTime at the beginning. This is useful if you want to add a delay to your animation. Next, check out the CCSequence; this allows you to string a bunch of actions together, and they will then happen one after another. CCDelayTime is pretty much only useful when used in conjunction with CCSequence, as it literally does nothing. When you have listed all of your objects, you must ad nil (the sentinel) so that the action knows to expect no more. If you don't do so, you will get the warning, \"Missing sentinel in function call\".",

Having all the main body parts of the character separated allows the developers to create the animations directly in the engine. This new animation technique is very similar to what is used in 3D animation.\nIn this tutorial, we're going to focus on bone-based animation. However, note that Unity does not do true bone-based animation, so we will simulate it.\nPreparing The Sprite For Animation\nDrag the sprite file to the editor and drop it on the Sprites folder, like so:\nBefore any character is ready for animation, you need to add a\nScene to the project. Create a\nScenes folder in your Assets directory, then create a new scene and save it as\nTest.scene within this folder. At the end of this step, you should have something like this:\nNow, still in the Project tab, select the\ndragon sprite, then look at the Inspector panel:\nAs you can see in the Sprite Mode property in the Inspector, the Sprite Mode is set to Single. This means that the engine will use the entire texture as a whole when creating a new sprite. Since we have the body parts separated in the\ndragon, we don't want that to happen. We therefore need to change the Sprite Mode from Single to Multiple.\nWhen you change the option, a new button labelled Sprite Editor appears:\nCurrently, the Sprite Editor slicing tool does not work well on compressed images. In order to ensure the best result for the animated sprites, you need to change the Format value on the bottom of the Inspector tab from the default option, Compressed, to Truecolor. Then, click Apply.\nNow, select the dragon sprite and click the Sprite Editor button. A new window will pop up:\nIn the upper left corner of the window, you will find the Slice button.

    "final_prompt": "\nBelow you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. \nPlease review the following texts carefully. \nWhile the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.\n\n---Begin Context---\nCreate 2D sprite-based games using an optimized animation system, physics simulation, and event-handling support.\n- iOS 7.0+\n- macOS 10.9+\n- tvOS 9.0+\n- watchOS 3.0+\nSpriteKit is a graphics rendering and animation infrastructure that you can use to animate arbitrary textured images, otherwise known as sprites. SpriteKit provides a traditional rendering loop that alternates between determining the contents of and rendering frames. You determine the contents of the frame and how those contents change. SpriteKit does the work to render that frame efficiently using graphics hardware. SpriteKit is optimized for applying arbitrary animations or changes to your content. This design makes SpriteKit more suitable for games and apps that require flexibility in how animations are handled.\nSprite Content is Drawn by Presenting Scenes Inside a Sprite View\nAnimation and rendering is performed by an\nSKView object. You place this view inside a window, then render content to it. Because it is a view, its contents can be combined with other views in the view hierarchy.\nContent in your game is organized into scenes, which are represented by\nSKScene objects. A scene holds sprites and other content to be rendered. A scene also implements per-frame logic and content processing. At any given time, the view presents one scene. As long as a scene is presented, its animation and per-frame logic are automatically executed.\nTo create a game or app using SpriteKit, you either subclasses the\nSKScene class or create a scene delegate to perform major game-related tasks. For example, you might create separate scene classes to display a main menu, the gameplay screen, and content displayed after the game ends. You can easily use a single\nSKView object in your window and switch between different scenes. When you switch scenes, you can use the\nSKTransition class to animate between the two scenes.\nA Node Tree Defines What Appears in a Scene\nSKScene class is a descendant of the\nSKNode class. When using SpriteKit, nodes are the fundamental building blocks for all content, with the scene object acting as the root node for a tree of node objects. The scene and its descendants determine which content is drawn and how it is rendered.\nEach node\u2019s position is specified in the coordinate system defined by its parent. A node also applies other properties to its content and the content of its descendants.\n\nFor example, when a node is rotated, all of its descendants are rotated also. You can build a complex image using a tree of nodes and then rotate, scale, and blend the entire image by adjusting the topmost node\u2019s properties.\nSKNode class does not draw anything, but it applies its properties to its descendants. Each kind of drawable content is represented by a distinct subclass in SpriteKit. Some other node subclasses do not draw content of their own, but modify the behavior of their descendants. For example, you can use an\nSKEffect object to apply a Core Image filter to an entire subtree in the scene. By precisely controlling the structure of the node tree, you determine the order in which nodes are rendered.\nAll node objects are responder objects, descending either from\nNSResponder, so you can subclass any node class and create new classes that accept user input. The view class automatically extends the responder chain to include the scene\u2019s node tree.\nSKNode reference for more information.\nTextures Hold Reusable Graphical Data\nTextures, represented as\nSKTexture objects, are shared images used to render sprites. Always use textures whenever you need to apply the same image to multiple sprites. Usually you create textures by loading image files stored in your app bundle. However, SpriteKit can also create textures for you at runtime from other sources, including Core Graphics images or even by rendering a node tree into a texture.\nSpriteKit simplifies texture management by handling the lower-level code required to load textures and make them available to the graphics hardware. Texture management is automatically managed by SpriteKit. However, if your game uses a large number of images, you can improve its performance by taking control of parts of the process. Primarily, you do this by telling SpriteKit explicitly to load a texture.\nA texture atlas is a group of related textures that are used together in your game. For example, you might use a texture atlas to store all of the textures needed to animate a character or all of the tiles needed to render the background of a gameplay level. SpriteKit uses texture atlases to improve rendering performance.\nNodes Execute Actions to Animate Content\nA scene\u2019s contents are animated using actions. Every action is an object, defined by the\nSKAction class. You tell nodes to execute actions. Then, when the scene processes frames of animation, the actions are executed.\n\nA video that demonstrates the use of Adobe Flash for creating sprites for use in animation in games. In this video, a game character is shown doing various actions which range from simple stance's to complex combo's The video explains the use of sprites and keyframes to be used in various actions. It also explains the use of pauses while executing the sprites so as to add fluidity to the action performed. This also reduces the number of frames required to perform an animation. Lastly, the narrator demonstrates how to draw the next keyframe in a sequence using an earlier keyframe as a reference.\n\nIt is often useful to sequence many actions together to save code; for example, in order to give the unit portriats a bit of a jump back, I use the following code:\nleftSprite.position = ccp(-leftSprite.contentSize.width / 2,\nleftSprite.contentSize.height / 2);\nCCDelayTime *delay = [CCDelayTime actionWithDuration:leftDelay];\nCCMoveTo *move1 = [CCMoveTo actionWithDuration:0.23f position:ccp(leftSprite.contentSize.width / 2, leftSprite.contentSize.height / 2)];\nCCMoveTo *move2 = [CCMoveTo actionWithDuration:0.02f position:ccp(leftSprite.contentSize.width / 2 - 5, leftSprite.contentSize.height / 2)];\n[leftSprite runAction:[CCSequence actions:delay, move1, move2, nil]];\n(leftDelay is a value I use to control which of the sprites appears first).\nTake note of two things; first, the CCDelayTime at the beginning. This is useful if you want to add a delay to your animation. Next, check out the CCSequence; this allows you to string a bunch of actions together, and they will then happen one after another. CCDelayTime is pretty much only useful when used in conjunction with CCSequence, as it literally does nothing. When you have listed all of your objects, you must ad nil (the sentinel) so that the action knows to expect no more. If you don't do so, you will get the warning, \"Missing sentinel in function call\".\n\nAs the name suggests, the animation will be on a per-bone basis, where each body bone can have a specific action or animation. Having all the main body parts of the character separated allows the developers to create the animations directly in the engine. This new animation technique is very similar to what is used in 3D animation.\nIn this tutorial, we're going to focus on bone-based animation. However, note that Unity does not do true bone-based animation, so we will simulate it.\nPreparing The Sprite For Animation\nDrag the sprite file to the editor and drop it on the Sprites folder, like so:\nBefore any character is ready for animation, you need to add a\nScene to the project. Create a\nScenes folder in your Assets directory, then create a new scene and save it as\nTest.scene within this folder. At the end of this step, you should have something like this:\nNow, still in the Project tab, select the\ndragon sprite, then look at the Inspector panel:\nAs you can see in the Sprite Mode property in the Inspector, the Sprite Mode is set to Single. This means that the engine will use the entire texture as a whole when creating a new sprite. Since we have the body parts separated in the\ndragon, we don't want that to happen. We therefore need to change the Sprite Mode from Single to Multiple.\nWhen you change the option, a new button labelled Sprite Editor appears:\nCurrently, the Sprite Editor slicing tool does not work well on compressed images. In order to ensure the best result for the animated sprites, you need to change the Format value on the bottom of the Inspector tab from the default option, Compressed, to Truecolor. Then, click Apply.\nNow, select the dragon sprite and click the Sprite Editor button. A new window will pop up:\nIn the upper left corner of the window, you will find the Slice button. Click on it, and another menu will pop up:\nThis menu allows you to change the parameters of how the sprite will be sliced by the engine. If you set the slices to Automatic, the engine will try to detect the different parts of the character you have in the image. You can define a minimum size for the slices, a pivot (the point around which the slice rotates) and one of three methods:\n- Delete Existing will replace any existing slices.\n- Smart will try to create new slices while retaining or adjusting the existing ones.\n---End Context---\n\n--Question--\nHow does SpriteKit handle animations and what are actions used for?\n\nInstructions:\n- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.\n- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.\n\n--Response Rules--\n- Response should be a json with key 'answer'",
    "answer": "In SpriteKit, animations are handled through actions. Actions are used to modify properties of nodes over time, such as position, scale, rotation, and alpha. They allow developers to create complex animations by sequencing multiple actions together, enabling nodes to move, change size, rotate, fade in or out, and more. This makes it easier to animate characters and objects in a game or application without having to manually adjust properties at every frame.",

The \"cradle of western civilisation\" is home to a host of immensely significant sites, places of importance, interest, beauty and impact. Not all of them reflect the civilisation we call Classical Greece - they range from prehistoric citadels via Classical temples to Byzantine monasteries and beyond.\nWORLD HERITAGE SITES ON OUR TOURS AND CRUISES IN GREECE\nThe most obvious image of Greece and one of the most famous architectural monuments in the world, the Acropolis is the sacred rock in the heart of the city, ancient and modern.

      {
        "passage": "As we know that energy is the capacity of the physical system to perform different tasks, without it no work can be done. When the work is done, the energy gets transferred from one body to the other as the external force, or sources always apply in the process of the work done. At the same time, it should be kept mentioned that the energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. Around everything in the world possesses energy, but that doesn\u2019t mean that energy always makes sure the work was done. The energy can even be stored within the body. By object\u2019s status with even possessing the energy, we mainly have two types of energy. One of which is the kinetic energy and the other is the potential energy. As both of them have the SI unit joule, people often found it difficult to differentiate it between both the types of energy. Kinetic energy is the type of energy, which a body possesses by the property of being in the motion. Contrary to this, the potential energy is the type of energy, which a body possesses by virtue of its position is known as the potential energy.\nWhat is Kinetic Energy?\nThe kinetic energy is the type of energy which a body possesses due to the virtue of being in the motion. In other words, we can say that the kinetic energy keeps the object in the motion. The motion of the object is evaluated with relation to the environment of the object. If the object changes its position with respect to the environment, then it is said to be in the motion. When the object is in the position of rest, and we pull it, but due to a heavy mass, it doesn\u2019t move. To make it move we apply more of the force on it. At last, the object gets in the motion. In all this process, the energy is transferred from the one body to the other to produce acceleration in the object carrying certain mass is known as the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is directly dependent on the speed and mass; the greater the speed and the mass, the more the kinetic energy of the body. When the moving object finally stops, in then the kinetic energy gets converted into the potential energy which puts an object on the rest. A misconception here prevails that the energy comes to an end, so the movement of the object stops, but that is not the case as the energy can\u2019t be created nor be destroyed.",

        "passage": "Conservation of Kinetic and Potential Energy\nEnergy comes in many different forms. It can\u2019t be created or destroyed, but it can move between objects and change forms. The energy of motion of a moving object is called kinetic energy, and is given by the equation\nKE = 0.5m(v^2)\nWhere m is the object\u2019s mass, and v is the object\u2019s velocity.\nAnother form of energy is called potential energy which is the energy an object has from being at a spot in a field where it would rather not be. When you lift an object up from the ground, the energy you put into lifting it becomes gravitational potential energy, given by PE = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 meters per second), and h is height. Pulling opposite poles of magnets apart or pushing identical poles close together also produces its own kind of potential energy.\nWhen you stop holding up an object, it starts to fall, and that gravitational potential energy transforms into kinetic energy (when it actually hits the ground, the energy gets dispersed in a complicated mess of heat and mechanical deformation).\nWhereas we could solve this problem using kinematic equations, conservation of energy makes these kind of problems much easier.\nThe total energy isn\u2019t going to change from start to finish. It will just move entirely from potential to kinetic. At the start, it\u2019s all potential, given by mgh.\n(5)(9.8)(200) = 9800 J That\u2019s joules by the way, the basic unit of energy.\nThis is all going to become kinetic energy, so:\n9800 = 0.5m(v^2)\n9800 = 0.5(5)(v^2)\n3920 = (v^2)\nsqrt(3920) = v = 62.6 m/s\nThis is an incredibly powerful trick. Using this method, we could even find how fast the rock is moving at any particular height just by finding the potential at that height, subtracting it from the starting total, and setting the leftover equal to kinetic energy.\nAbout The Author\n|Physics Guru And General Math And Science Enthusia|\n|I\\'ve always had a passion for learning science and then turning around and teaching it to anyone who will listen.

'It came from nowhere! the law of conservation of energy only holds under the conditions in which general relativity is valid; that is, in an indented-rubber-sheet universe. Wherever the indentation is flattened out, general relativity no longer holds, and energy can be created and destroyed freely.

When the work is done, the energy gets transferred from one body to the other as the external force, or sources always apply in the process of the work done. At the same time, it should be kept mentioned that the energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. Around everything in the world possesses energy, but that doesn\u2019t mean that energy always makes sure the work was done. The energy can even be stored within the body. By object\u2019s status with even possessing the energy, we mainly have two types of energy. One of which is the kinetic energy and the other is the potential energy. As both of them have the SI unit joule, people often found it difficult to differentiate it between both the types of energy. Kinetic energy is the type of energy, which a body possesses by the property of being in the motion. Contrary to this, the potential energy is the type of energy, which a body possesses by virtue of its position is known as the potential energy.\nWhat is Kinetic Energy?\nThe kinetic energy is the type of energy which a body possesses due to the virtue of being in the motion. In other words, we can say that the kinetic energy keeps the object in the motion. The motion of the object is evaluated with relation to the environment of the object. If the object changes its position with respect to the environment, then it is said to be in the motion. When the object is in the position of rest, and we pull it, but due to a heavy mass, it doesn\u2019t move. To make it move we apply more of the force on it. At last, the object gets in the motion. In all this process, the energy is transferred from the one body to the other to produce acceleration in the object carrying certain mass is known as the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is directly dependent on the speed and mass; the greater the speed and the mass, the more the kinetic energy of the body. When the moving object finally stops, in then the kinetic energy gets converted into the potential energy which puts an object on the rest. A misconception here prevails that the energy comes to an end, so the movement of the object stops, but that is not the case as the energy can\u2019t be created nor be destroyed.\n\nConservation of Kinetic and Potential Energy\nEnergy comes in many different forms. It can\u2019t be created or destroyed, but it can move between objects and change forms. The energy of motion of a moving object is called kinetic energy, and is given by the equation\nKE = 0.5m(v^2)\nWhere m is the object\u2019s mass, and v is the object\u2019s velocity.\nAnother form of energy is called potential energy which is the energy an object has from being at a spot in a field where it would rather not be. When you lift an object up from the ground, the energy you put into lifting it becomes gravitational potential energy, given by PE = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 meters per second), and h is height. Pulling opposite poles of magnets apart or pushing identical poles close together also produces its own kind of potential energy.\nWhen you stop holding up an object, it starts to fall, and that gravitational potential energy transforms into kinetic energy (when it actually hits the ground, the energy gets dispersed in a complicated mess of heat and mechanical deformation).\nWhereas we could solve this problem using kinematic equations, conservation of energy makes these kind of problems much easier.\nThe total energy isn\u2019t going to change from start to finish. It will just move entirely from potential to kinetic. At the start, it\u2019s all potential, given by mgh.\n(5)(9.8)(200) = 9800 J That\u2019s joules by the way, the basic unit of energy.\nThis is all going to become kinetic energy, so:\n9800 = 0.5m(v^2)\n9800 = 0.5(5)(v^2)\n3920 = (v^2)\nsqrt(3920) = v = 62.6 m/s\nThis is an incredibly powerful trick. Using this method, we could even find how fast the rock is moving at any particular height just by finding the potential at that height, subtracting it from the starting total, and setting the leftover equal to kinetic energy.\nAbout The Author\n|Physics Guru And General Math And Science Enthusia|\n|I\\'ve always had a passion for learning science and then turning around and teaching it to anyone who will listen. My interest led me to an undergrad degree in physics, an attempt at a teaching credential (which unfortunately imploded at 95% completion in an administrative snarl), a jump to a Master...|\n\nBCA Semester 1: Physics - Forms of EnergyQ & A\nQ(2013): (a) State Law of Conservation of Energy.\n(b) Write the names of different forms of energy.\nLaw of Conservation of Energy: This law states that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, but can change form. It means total energy of an isolated system cannot change. The total energy E of a system can change only by amounts of energy that are transferred to or from the system.\ni.e. W = \u25b3E = \u25b3Emech + \u25b3Eth + \u25b3Eint\nwhere \u25b3Emech = change in mechanical energy,\n\u25b3Eth = change in thermal energy\n\u25b3Eint = change in other type of internal energy of the system.\n(b) Forms of Energy\n|Type of Energy||Description|\n|Kinetic||Due to motion of a body|\n|Potential||Due to position or configuration of the body.|\n|Mechanical||Sum of potential and kinetic energy of a body.|\n|Electrical||Due to electrical field around a body.|\n|Chemical||Due to atoms and molecules of a body|\n|Magnetic||Due to magnetic field|\n|Nuclear||Due to binding force between sub-atomic particles.|\n|Gravitational||Due to gravitational Field|\n|Radiant||Due to radiation including light|\n|Thermal or Heat||heat energy due to difference in temperature|\n|Intrinsic or Internal||Due to mass possessed by an object|\nQ (2011): Does kinetic energy of a body depend upon direction of motion? Justify your answer.\nAnswer: No. Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity. It does not depend on the direction of motion. It depends on mass and magnitude of speed.\n\nthe law of conservation of energy states that energy can not be create nor destroyed, it can only be changed from 1 kind of energy to another kind.\nwith this in mind, you have to consider where your enery source is( your battery)....everytime you converts that energy into something else, there are inefficiencies associated to every conversion. the battery has internal resistance, the wires have internal resistance, the controller requires power just to operate, the motor is only 80% efficient at converting the energy to motion. each of thes processes produce heat. your battery power is lost due to this heat.\nthen once the energy is mechanical energy, you have to consider the friction and rolling inefficiencies of your bearings,chain, wheels rolling on a less than smooth surface, even wind resistance.\nBottom line, by the time your generator has produced electricity for your battery, it is only a fraction of the electricity required to move your bike forward.\nnow if you consider that you are pedalling, too. then you are actually getting power from your muscles too. You might wonder if your muscles are capable of compensating for all the losses in your electric system, and it certainly can if you pedal hard enough and fast enough. But, in the real time, the losses from you electric system are greater than what you can provide from your muscles. Eventually, you need to stop the bike and plug it into the wall to recharge the battery.\n\nBy now that billiard ball is off in space, far beyond the edge of the Solar System and it will continue to travel so forever, at nearly the speed of light, until it happens to strike an object large enough to stop it. And then it will gouge out a sizable crater.'\nI played with the notion and was not sure I liked it. 'How is that possible? The billiard ball entered the zero-gravity volume almost at a standstill. I saw it. And you say it left with an incredible quantity of kinetic energy. Where did the energy come from?'\nPriss shrugged. 'It came from nowhere! the law of conservation of energy only holds under the conditions in which general relativity is valid; that is, in an indented-rubber-sheet universe. Wherever the indentation is flattened out, general relativity no longer holds, and energy can be created and destroyed freely. That accounts for the radiation along the cylindrical surface of the zero-gravity volume. That radiation, you remember. Bloom did not explain, and, I fear, could not explain. If he had only experimented further first; if he had only not been so foolishly anxious to put on his show-'\n'What accounts for the radiation, sir?'\nThe molecules of air inside the volume. Each assumes the speed of light and conies smashing outward. They're only molecules, not billiard balls, so they're stopped, but the kinetic energy of their motion is converted into energetic radiation. It's continuous because new molecules are always drifting in, and attaining the speed of light and smashing out.'\nThen energy is being created continuously?'\n'Exactly. And that is what we must make clear to the public. Anti-gravity is not primarily a device to lift spaceships or to revolutionize mechanical movement. Rather, it is the source of an endless supply of free energy, since part of the energy produced can be diverted to maintain the field that keeps that portion of the Universe flat.

It is used to separate mixtures, to check the purity of a mixture, or to monitor the progress of a reaction. The polarity of the solute, polarity of solvent, and polarity of adsorbent are crucial factors that determine the mobility rate of a compound along a TLC plate. This technique helps separate different mixtures of compounds based on their mobility differences. TLC can also be used to identify compounds by comparing it to a known compound\nThin layer chromatography (TLC): this technique was used to separate dried liquids with using liquid solvent (mobile phase) and a glass plate covered with silica gel (stationary phase). Basically, we can use any organic substance (cellulose polyamide, polyethylene, etc.) or inorganic substance (silica gel, aluminum oxide, etc.) in TLC. These substances must be able to divide and form uniform layers. On the surface of the plate, will be a very thin layer of silica which is considered the stationary phase. Then, add a small amount of solvent into a wide-mouth container (i.e. beaker or developing jar) just enough to cover the bottom of the container. Place the prepared TLC plate into the sealed container which has small amount of a solvent (moving phase). Due to capillary action, the solvent moves up to the plate and now we can remove the plate and analyze the Rf values.\nUsually TLC is done on a glass, plastic, or aluminum plate coated with silica gel, aluminum oxide, or cellulose. This coating is called the stationary phase. The sample is then applied to the bottom of the plate and the plate placed in a solvent, or the mobile phase. Capillary action pushes the sample up the plate. The rate the samples move up the plate depends on how tightly the sample binds to the stationary phase. This is determined by polarity. The Rf values or the Retention Factors are then compared for analysis. The retardation factor of a solute is defined as the ratio between the distance traveled by a compound to that of the solvent in a given amount of time. For this reason, Rf values will vary from a minimum of 0.0 to a maximum of 1.0.",

    "answer": "Rf value, or retention factor, in chromatography is a measure used to compare the movement of different compounds through a stationary phase relative to the solvent. It is calculated as the ratio of the distance traveled by the compound to the distance traveled by the solvent front. To measure Rf value, a small spot of the sample is placed on a chromatography paper or plate, which is then immersed in a suitable solvent. The solvent moves up the paper via capillary action, carrying the sample compounds with it. Once the solvent reaches a certain level, the paper is removed, dried, and the distances traveled by the solvent front and the individual compounds are measured. The Rf value for each compound is then calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the compound by the distance traveled by the solvent front.",

    "passages": [
      {
        "passage": "Driving alongside an 18-wheeler big rig or semi truck can be scary. Not only is the sheer size of a large truck intimidating, but at some point while sharing the road with one, we inevitably stop and think about just how devastating an accident with such a monstrous vehicle would be. Truck accidents can cause a horrendous amount of destruction due to how much weight and force they carry.\nLuckily, there are a few things any driver can do to stay safe while sharing the road with large trucks. Here are some tips:\n- Always be especially alert when driving near a large trailer truck or big rig. Look out for any sudden swerves or movements.\n- Make sure you\u2019re always visible to the driver of the truck. Trucks have massive blind spots and a higher cab, so it can be difficult for truck drivers to see passenger cars. Avoid driving in a truck\u2019s blind spots and make yourself visible directly from the driver\u2019s cab if possible. If you can see the driver in their mirror, they should be able to see you as well.\n- Turn your headlights on in conditions where the light is low to help truck drivers see your better.\n- Keep a safer difference than you normally would when following or driving alongside a large truck. Keep an extra lane between the truck and your vehicle if possible.\n- Give trucks as much room as possible when you notice they\u2019re making a turn. The driver will need to make a wide turn and it may be wider than you expect. While waiting your turn at an intersection, for example, you may want to give the truck the entire intersection to make their turn before moving forward.\n- Give large trucks more space to stop. The larger the vehicle, the more time it takes for the driver to stop. Overcompensate if you have to. A large truck with full cargo can take as much as 300 yards to come to a complete stop from 60mph.\n- When driving around a large truck, plan your moves well ahead of time and give truck drivers more time to respond to your actions.\n- Use your turn signals earlier and merge/change lanes ahead of time. If you\u2019re afraid of being too close to the truck and need to stop, alert the driver ahead of time with a quick \u201ctap\u201d on your brakes.\n- When passing a large truck, try and pass on the right side. The right side has fewer blind spots than the left.",

High centers of gravity make it easier for trucks to tip over. They will often move into adjacent lanes prior to and after a turning maneuver to avoid driving over a curb or sidewalk or hitting a car in an opposing travel lane.\nDon\u2019t try to sneak past the right side and squeeze around them \u2013 it may be the last mistake you\u2019ll ever make.\nWatch for the truck\u2019s turn signal to see what the driver intends to do. Occasionally, truck drivers will fail to signal or the trailer signal light may be inoperative. Never attempt to cut in along the right side as the driver maneuvers left or you way become sandwiched between the turning truck and the curb. Safe drivers will avoid the truck\u2019s No-Zones and wait to assess the truck driver\u2019s intent before passing.\nAs a general rule, avoid passing trucks while turning and never pass them on the right side.\nDon\u2019t Crowd an Intersection\nMany intersections are marked with stop lines, indicating where a driver must come to a complete stop. Crowding an intersection means to stop beyond the stop lines, leaving your vehicle exposed to trucks attempting to turn, as well as other vehicles and pedestrians. Crowding an intersection is illegal and puts you at risk of being hit by trucks and other vehicles turning from other areas of the intersection.\nDownload the wide turns fact sheet (pdf)\nA semi\u2019s height (up to 14\u2032), length and weight make it nearly impossible for the driver to make tight turns like regular cars and trucks. A fully-loaded truck also has a much higher center of gravity than typical passenger vehicles and SUVs, making it easier for a truck to tip over. Read more in the PDF.",

        "passage": "I would refer to the WB-62 design vehicle, which means a multi-unit tractor-trailer combination that has a 62 foot wheel base. This truck is actually about 69 feet from nose to tail. There are also the WB-40 and the WB-50 and the WB-65. For trivia purposes, the WB-65, which is 74 feet from nose to tail, is the vehicle used when designing interstaets and interstate ramp terminals.\nThe importance of the design vehicle becomes clear when you start putting together the design of intersections and sharp curves. Larger trucks need more room in order to make turns. The rear wheels of a truck\u2013well, of any vehicle, really\u2013will run to the inside of the front wheels. This wider path made during a turn is called overtracking, and its why you see large trucks swing out really wide when they\u2019re making right angle turns at intersections. The distance and width needed to ensure that the rear wheels of the design vehicle stay off the edge of pavement, or out of the adjacent lanes, can add a lot of cost to a design project.\nNext time you\u2019re walking in an area that has curbs and you come to an intersection, look at the corners. Do you see tire tracks up against the curb faces? Do you see tire tracks on top of the curb, or on the sidewalk? Are the corners, maybe including the pedestrian ramps, broken and cracked? If any of these are true, it means most likely that truck drivers are running their rear wheels up and over the curbs when they\u2019re trying to make turns. This could be becuase the driver isn\u2019t very good, but more likely it\u2019s because there\u2019s not enough room for the trucks to clear when taking their overtracking into account.\nLarge vehicles are also important to consider when we\u2019re designing intersections and considering the time it takes to accelerate. For example, the distance you need to be able to see to your left, or to your right, when you\u2019re trying to turn onto a roadway. On a 45 mile per hour road, with no other consideations, that distance should be 500 feet if you\u2019re driving a car. If you\u2019re driving a tractor trailer, then I have to add another 270 feet! A football field worth of view, basically. That means no hills, curves or bushes to block the view of that truck driver trying to make a left turn.",

These vehicles are massive in comparison to smaller passenger vehicles, so it makes sense that drivers may feel wary when they approach larger trucks.\nThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration explains that it\u2019s important to give large trucks enough space around them. Doing so makes it possible for the driver to see your vehicle by keeping the blind spots clear. Additionally, staying a distance away from the vehicle may give the driver more time to slow down or maneuver when necessary.\nLarge trucks have four main blind spots\nWhen you approach a semitruck from the back, remember that there are four blind spots that you need to keep your vehicle out of. The first blind spot is directly behind the vehicle.

Taking a turn too sharply or widely can lead to costly accidents and serious injuries. One common type of accident is the right turn squeeze crash, which occurs when a truck driver makes a wide right turn, leaving too much distance between the truck and the curb. When doing so, other drivers on the road may try to squeeze past the truck and could end up getting their vehicle caught underneath the truck\u2019s trailer.\nIn order to make right turns as safe as possible, drivers should be aware of their environments and the potential challenges that they may impose. For example, a particularly narrow intersection can make right turns especially dangerous.\nIt is also important that the vehicles and trailers are in proper working order. A broken turn signal or a lack of adequate mirrors will make any type of driving unsafe.\nThere are many steps to making a turn. As a truck driver, you have a responsibility for not only your own safety, but that of pedestrians and other drivers as well. When making a right turn, adhere to the following steps in order to make the process as safe as possible:\n- Prepare for the turn by moving into the right-hand lane as early as you can.\n- Activate your turn signal well in advance, and reduce your speed.\n- As you approach the intersection, observe the area and make sure that you will be able to safely complete the turn.\n- When beginning your turn, keep the rear of your trailer in the right-hand lane and close to the curb.\n- Avoid swinging wide to the left or crossing into other lanes.\n- Use your mirrors to check for other vehicles, pedestrians or obstructions.\n- Never back up when completing a turn.\nIf you are unable to finish a turn, wait for other traffic to clear to do so.\nAs a driver, safety should be your top priority. If you find that a turn may not be possible, it is better to take a slight detour and ensure that you will be able to get to your destination safely. A small delay is far less costly than an accident. If you have any questions about making right turns safely, talk to your supervisor.",

    "final_prompt": "\nBelow you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. \nPlease review the following texts carefully. \nWhile the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.\n\n---Begin Context---\nDriving alongside an 18-wheeler big rig or semi truck can be scary. Not only is the sheer size of a large truck intimidating, but at some point while sharing the road with one, we inevitably stop and think about just how devastating an accident with such a monstrous vehicle would be. Truck accidents can cause a horrendous amount of destruction due to how much weight and force they carry.\nLuckily, there are a few things any driver can do to stay safe while sharing the road with large trucks. Here are some tips:\n- Always be especially alert when driving near a large trailer truck or big rig. Look out for any sudden swerves or movements.\n- Make sure you\u2019re always visible to the driver of the truck. Trucks have massive blind spots and a higher cab, so it can be difficult for truck drivers to see passenger cars. Avoid driving in a truck\u2019s blind spots and make yourself visible directly from the driver\u2019s cab if possible. If you can see the driver in their mirror, they should be able to see you as well.\n- Turn your headlights on in conditions where the light is low to help truck drivers see your better.\n- Keep a safer difference than you normally would when following or driving alongside a large truck. Keep an extra lane between the truck and your vehicle if possible.\n- Give trucks as much room as possible when you notice they\u2019re making a turn. The driver will need to make a wide turn and it may be wider than you expect. While waiting your turn at an intersection, for example, you may want to give the truck the entire intersection to make their turn before moving forward.\n- Give large trucks more space to stop. The larger the vehicle, the more time it takes for the driver to stop. Overcompensate if you have to. A large truck with full cargo can take as much as 300 yards to come to a complete stop from 60mph.\n- When driving around a large truck, plan your moves well ahead of time and give truck drivers more time to respond to your actions.\n- Use your turn signals earlier and merge/change lanes ahead of time. If you\u2019re afraid of being too close to the truck and need to stop, alert the driver ahead of time with a quick \u201ctap\u201d on your brakes.\n- When passing a large truck, try and pass on the right side. The right side has fewer blind spots than the left.\n\nTrucks Make Wide Turns\nWith a height up of up to 14 feet, fully-loaded trucks have a much higher center of gravity than typical passenger vehicles, or even SUVs (4.5 feet \u2013 5 feet and 6.5 feet high, respectively). High centers of gravity make it easier for trucks to tip over. They will often move into adjacent lanes prior to and after a turning maneuver to avoid driving over a curb or sidewalk or hitting a car in an opposing travel lane.\nDon\u2019t try to sneak past the right side and squeeze around them \u2013 it may be the last mistake you\u2019ll ever make.\nWatch for the truck\u2019s turn signal to see what the driver intends to do. Occasionally, truck drivers will fail to signal or the trailer signal light may be inoperative. Never attempt to cut in along the right side as the driver maneuvers left or you way become sandwiched between the turning truck and the curb. Safe drivers will avoid the truck\u2019s No-Zones and wait to assess the truck driver\u2019s intent before passing.\nAs a general rule, avoid passing trucks while turning and never pass them on the right side.\nDon\u2019t Crowd an Intersection\nMany intersections are marked with stop lines, indicating where a driver must come to a complete stop. Crowding an intersection means to stop beyond the stop lines, leaving your vehicle exposed to trucks attempting to turn, as well as other vehicles and pedestrians. Crowding an intersection is illegal and puts you at risk of being hit by trucks and other vehicles turning from other areas of the intersection.\nDownload the wide turns fact sheet (pdf)\nA semi\u2019s height (up to 14\u2032), length and weight make it nearly impossible for the driver to make tight turns like regular cars and trucks. A fully-loaded truck also has a much higher center of gravity than typical passenger vehicles and SUVs, making it easier for a truck to tip over. Read more in the PDF.\n\nI would refer to the WB-62 design vehicle, which means a multi-unit tractor-trailer combination that has a 62 foot wheel base. This truck is actually about 69 feet from nose to tail. There are also the WB-40 and the WB-50 and the WB-65. For trivia purposes, the WB-65, which is 74 feet from nose to tail, is the vehicle used when designing interstaets and interstate ramp terminals.\nThe importance of the design vehicle becomes clear when you start putting together the design of intersections and sharp curves. Larger trucks need more room in order to make turns. The rear wheels of a truck\u2013well, of any vehicle, really\u2013will run to the inside of the front wheels. This wider path made during a turn is called overtracking, and its why you see large trucks swing out really wide when they\u2019re making right angle turns at intersections. The distance and width needed to ensure that the rear wheels of the design vehicle stay off the edge of pavement, or out of the adjacent lanes, can add a lot of cost to a design project.\nNext time you\u2019re walking in an area that has curbs and you come to an intersection, look at the corners. Do you see tire tracks up against the curb faces? Do you see tire tracks on top of the curb, or on the sidewalk? Are the corners, maybe including the pedestrian ramps, broken and cracked? If any of these are true, it means most likely that truck drivers are running their rear wheels up and over the curbs when they\u2019re trying to make turns. This could be becuase the driver isn\u2019t very good, but more likely it\u2019s because there\u2019s not enough room for the trucks to clear when taking their overtracking into account.\nLarge vehicles are also important to consider when we\u2019re designing intersections and considering the time it takes to accelerate. For example, the distance you need to be able to see to your left, or to your right, when you\u2019re trying to turn onto a roadway. On a 45 mile per hour road, with no other consideations, that distance should be 500 feet if you\u2019re driving a car. If you\u2019re driving a tractor trailer, then I have to add another 270 feet! A football field worth of view, basically. That means no hills, curves or bushes to block the view of that truck driver trying to make a left turn.\n\nAnyone who has ever traveled on a freeway or highway has probably come into range of a large truck or semi. These vehicles are massive in comparison to smaller passenger vehicles, so it makes sense that drivers may feel wary when they approach larger trucks.\nThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration explains that it\u2019s important to give large trucks enough space around them. Doing so makes it possible for the driver to see your vehicle by keeping the blind spots clear. Additionally, staying a distance away from the vehicle may give the driver more time to slow down or maneuver when necessary.\nLarge trucks have four main blind spots\nWhen you approach a semitruck from the back, remember that there are four blind spots that you need to keep your vehicle out of. The first blind spot is directly behind the vehicle. If you are close enough to the back that you can\u2019t see the driver\u2019s mirrors, the driver cannot see you.\nTwo additional blind spots run along the sides of a semi. These are areas in which the mirror is angled in a way that it will miss any vehicles next to the truck, and the driver won\u2019t see them when looking over, either.\nThe fourth blind spot is in front of the truck. If you weave in front of the truck too closely, the driver won\u2019t be able to see you over the front hood.\nStopping distances are a challenge for large truck drivers\nAnother reason you need to give more space to large trucks is because of their stopping distances. Trucks, buses and other large vehicles need more time to stop, so you\u2019ll want to be several car lengths ahead of the vehicle at all times.\nTurns become problematic for truck drivers\nDue to the shape of a large truck, drivers often have trouble turning and staying in the correct lane when turning right.

It was led by Giuseppe Mazzini. He believed in revolutionary action to unite Italy as a republic, rather than as a monarchy.\nHowever it is always difficult to build a mass movement under a dictatorship, and Garibaldi\u2019s first experience of armed insurrection, in Genoa in 1834, was a dismal failure.\nThe following year Garibaldi moved to South America where he spent the next 13 years taking part in a variety of national liberation movements.\nWord of his exploits started to feed back to Italy and he acquired a reputation as the \u201chero of two worlds\u201d.\nThe year 1848 was a turning point for popular struggle throughout Europe, as revolt after revolt broke out against hated rulers. This continent-wide uprising began in Sicily.\nKarl Marx noted at the time, \u201cThe bloody revolt of the people in Palermo affected the paralysed mass of the people like an electric shock and reawakened their great revolutionary memories and passions.\u201d\nIn northern Italy the catalyst was revolution in Austria and the fall of its ruler, Prince Metternich. The Austrian army was occupying northern Italy and many began to desert. An uprising broke out in Milan four days after Metternich\u2019s fall.\nPoor people and peasants supported this movement, since they suffered from conscription into the Austrian army \u2013 which landowners could pay to avoid \u2013 and had to pay heavy taxes to the Austrian empire.\nThe whole continent was soon in revolt. As Marx wrote, \u201cEvery postal delivery brought a fresh report of revolution, now from Italy, now from Germany, now from the remotest south east of Europe, and sustained the general intoxication of the people.\u201d\nOne of the highest points in this revolutionary wave was the Roman Republic, proclaimed in Rome in January 1849.\nNot only did it oppose monarchy, it was also in favour of fair systems of taxation. It all looked similar to the French Revolution of 1789, right down to the planting of \u201ctrees of liberty\u201d.\nIndeed there had been another revolution in France the previous June.",

        "passage": "Giuseppe Garibaldi and The Creation of Italy. Rome today\nGiuseppe Garibaldi and his Achievements for Italy\nThe son of a seaman, he was born on July 4, 1807, in Nice, which is now in France but was then an Italian town. From his earliest years he loved adventure, and at the age of 15 tried to run away to sea. With his father's agreement he later went to sea and by the time he was 25 had worked his way from cabin boy to captain.\nIn 1832 came the turning point of Garibaldi's life, for he met another Italian, Giuseppe Mazzini, who was the organiser of the \u201cYoung Italy\u201d movement. At this time Italy was made up of several separate states, many of which were ruled by kings who paid no attention to the wishes of their people. Great parts of what is now northern Italy belonged to Austria. The members of the \u201cYoung Italy\u201d movement sought to drive out the Austrians, to unite all the states into one country and to set up one government for the whole country. They were determined to make that government democratic; that is, to have a government that would rule in accordance with the wishes of the people.\nIn 1834 Garibaldi helped Mazzini to organise a rebellion in Savoy (northem Italy). The attempt failed, Garibaldi fled to France, was sentenced to death in his absence and went to live in exile in South America. For 12 years he led a band of men who were fighting for the Republic of the Rio Grande, which was rebelling against Brazil. He suffered shipwreck, imprisonment and torture so bravely that his followers worshipped him. He organised other Italian exiles into an army known as the Italian Legion, which in 1843 and 1846 saved Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, from attack by Argentina.\nIn 1848 Garibaldi returned to Italy and found the north Italians in revolt against the Austrians. He formed and fought with a volunteer army of 3,000 men, but after the Italians were defeated had to escape to Switzerland. In 1849 he was back in Italy, defending Rome against the French. The people of Rome had rebelled against the government of the Pope (who at that time ruled over great areas in the same way as an ordinary king), and set up their own government.",

        "passage": "As Marx noted, \u201cThe Roman revolution was an attack on property and bourgeois order as dreadful as the June revolution [in France].\u201d\nBut the revolution in France had been defeated, so \u201cthe re-establishment of bourgeois rule in France required the restoration of papal rule in Rome\u201d.\nRadical ideas had already taken hold in Venice and Florence. This was another reason for 6,000 French troops to attack the radicals in control of Rome.\nHaving just returned from South America, Garibaldi led working class volunteers in a heroic defence of the city for three months until 20,000 professional soldiers finally crushed them.\nItalian democrats had been defeated once again by powerful foreign forces. But they had been most successful in areas where working class people had been part of their struggle.\nWorkers saw that they were fighting for something far more important than a flag.\n\u201cThe Hungarian, the Pole, the Italian shall not be free as long as the worker remains a slave,\u201d as Marx put it.\nGaribaldi and Mazzini moved in the opposite direction, however, trying to break the link between national independence and political egalitarianism.\nThey united with nationalists in Piedmont in the north, whose leaders wanted to make an alliance with France to get the Austrians out of northern Italy alone.\nCount Cavour, the prime minister of Piedmont, admitted he knew far more about southern England than southern Italy \u2013 he even once claimed that Sicilians spoke Arabic!\nBut whatever his inclinations, Cavour still needed Garibaldi for his military skills and popularity. If Garibaldi appealed for volunteers, people came running.\nAfter a series of incredible victories against the Austrians in the north, Garibaldi was allowed to sail to Sicily in April 1860, which was already in revolt. He left with just 1,000 men \u2013 and there has since always been a suspicion that Cavour sent him off as a diversion, expecting him to be killed.\nYet in Sicily Garibaldi won a stunning victory against one of Europe\u2019s most powerful armies. The rebels were forced to use unorthodox tactics at times, such as charging the enemy with fixed bayonets because their rifles were so old and unreliable.\nJust as in 1848, the rebel victory happened because peasants rose throughout Sicily against their landlords and joined Garibaldi. But in other respects this was a different revolution from 1848, which was an attempted \u201crevolution from below\u201d.",

It was led by Giuseppe Mazzini. He believed in revolutionary action to unite Italy as a republic, rather than as a monarchy.\nHowever it is always difficult to build a mass movement under a dictatorship, and Garibaldi\u2019s first experience of armed insurrection, in Genoa in 1834, was a dismal failure.\nThe following year Garibaldi moved to South America where he spent the next 13 years taking part in a variety of national liberation movements.\nWord of his exploits started to feed back to Italy and he acquired a reputation as the \u201chero of two worlds\u201d.\nThe year 1848 was a turning point for popular struggle throughout Europe, as revolt after revolt broke out against hated rulers. This continent-wide uprising began in Sicily.\nKarl Marx noted at the time, \u201cThe bloody revolt of the people in Palermo affected the paralysed mass of the people like an electric shock and reawakened their great revolutionary memories and passions.\u201d\nIn northern Italy the catalyst was revolution in Austria and the fall of its ruler, Prince Metternich. The Austrian army was occupying northern Italy and many began to desert. An uprising broke out in Milan four days after Metternich\u2019s fall.\nPoor people and peasants supported this movement, since they suffered from conscription into the Austrian army \u2013 which landowners could pay to avoid \u2013 and had to pay heavy taxes to the Austrian empire.\nThe whole continent was soon in revolt. As Marx wrote, \u201cEvery postal delivery brought a fresh report of revolution, now from Italy, now from Germany, now from the remotest south east of Europe, and sustained the general intoxication of the people.\u201d\nOne of the highest points in this revolutionary wave was the Roman Republic, proclaimed in Rome in January 1849.\nNot only did it oppose monarchy, it was also in favour of fair systems of taxation. It all looked similar to the French Revolution of 1789, right down to the planting of \u201ctrees of liberty\u201d.\nIndeed there had been another revolution in France the previous June.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi and The Creation of Italy. Rome today\nGiuseppe Garibaldi and his Achievements for Italy\nThe son of a seaman, he was born on July 4, 1807, in Nice, which is now in France but was then an Italian town. From his earliest years he loved adventure, and at the age of 15 tried to run away to sea. With his father's agreement he later went to sea and by the time he was 25 had worked his way from cabin boy to captain.\nIn 1832 came the turning point of Garibaldi's life, for he met another Italian, Giuseppe Mazzini, who was the organiser of the \u201cYoung Italy\u201d movement. At this time Italy was made up of several separate states, many of which were ruled by kings who paid no attention to the wishes of their people. Great parts of what is now northern Italy belonged to Austria. The members of the \u201cYoung Italy\u201d movement sought to drive out the Austrians, to unite all the states into one country and to set up one government for the whole country. They were determined to make that government democratic; that is, to have a government that would rule in accordance with the wishes of the people.\nIn 1834 Garibaldi helped Mazzini to organise a rebellion in Savoy (northem Italy). The attempt failed, Garibaldi fled to France, was sentenced to death in his absence and went to live in exile in South America. For 12 years he led a band of men who were fighting for the Republic of the Rio Grande, which was rebelling against Brazil. He suffered shipwreck, imprisonment and torture so bravely that his followers worshipped him. He organised other Italian exiles into an army known as the Italian Legion, which in 1843 and 1846 saved Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, from attack by Argentina.\nIn 1848 Garibaldi returned to Italy and found the north Italians in revolt against the Austrians. He formed and fought with a volunteer army of 3,000 men, but after the Italians were defeated had to escape to Switzerland. In 1849 he was back in Italy, defending Rome against the French. The people of Rome had rebelled against the government of the Pope (who at that time ruled over great areas in the same way as an ordinary king), and set up their own government.\n\nAs Marx noted, \u201cThe Roman revolution was an attack on property and bourgeois order as dreadful as the June revolution [in France].\u201d\nBut the revolution in France had been defeated, so \u201cthe re-establishment of bourgeois rule in France required the restoration of papal rule in Rome\u201d.\nRadical ideas had already taken hold in Venice and Florence. This was another reason for 6,000 French troops to attack the radicals in control of Rome.\nHaving just returned from South America, Garibaldi led working class volunteers in a heroic defence of the city for three months until 20,000 professional soldiers finally crushed them.\nItalian democrats had been defeated once again by powerful foreign forces. But they had been most successful in areas where working class people had been part of their struggle.\nWorkers saw that they were fighting for something far more important than a flag.\n\u201cThe Hungarian, the Pole, the Italian shall not be free as long as the worker remains a slave,\u201d as Marx put it.\nGaribaldi and Mazzini moved in the opposite direction, however, trying to break the link between national independence and political egalitarianism.\nThey united with nationalists in Piedmont in the north, whose leaders wanted to make an alliance with France to get the Austrians out of northern Italy alone.\nCount Cavour, the prime minister of Piedmont, admitted he knew far more about southern England than southern Italy \u2013 he even once claimed that Sicilians spoke Arabic!\nBut whatever his inclinations, Cavour still needed Garibaldi for his military skills and popularity. If Garibaldi appealed for volunteers, people came running.\nAfter a series of incredible victories against the Austrians in the north, Garibaldi was allowed to sail to Sicily in April 1860, which was already in revolt. He left with just 1,000 men \u2013 and there has since always been a suspicion that Cavour sent him off as a diversion, expecting him to be killed.\nYet in Sicily Garibaldi won a stunning victory against one of Europe\u2019s most powerful armies. The rebels were forced to use unorthodox tactics at times, such as charging the enemy with fixed bayonets because their rifles were so old and unreliable.\nJust as in 1848, the rebel victory happened because peasants rose throughout Sicily against their landlords and joined Garibaldi. But in other respects this was a different revolution from 1848, which was an attempted \u201crevolution from below\u201d.\n---End Context---\n\n--Question--\nWhat was the purpose of the uprising in Italy in 1861 led by Garibaldi and his thousand men?\n\nInstructions:\n- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.\n- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.\n\n--Response Rules--\n- Response should be a json with key 'answer'",

    "answer": "The maximum delta-v that can be achieved depends on the starting and end mass, as well as the specific impulse (Isp) of the engine. Using the rocket equation, delta-v (\u0394v) = Isp * g * ln(start mass / end mass), where g is the standard gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s\u00b2). With an Isp of 350 seconds, the maximum delta-v would be determined by the specific masses involved. Without those values, we can't calculate a precise number, but the equation provides the framework for that calculation.",

      {
        "passage": "Marshall Lytle, whose snappy bass work anchored Bill Haley and the Comets' \"Rock Around the Clock,\" died Saturday at his home in New Port Richie, Florida. He was 79. According to The New York Times, Lytle died of lung cancer.\nLytle was a teenage guitar player working at a Chester, Pennsylvania, radio station when Haley, who worked at another station, recruited him to play bass. Lytle notably didn't play the instrument, but Haley taught him the rudiments of slap-bass in a 30-minute session. The technique was key for country music, which was the focus of Haley's band \u2013 then known as Bill Haley and His Saddlemen.\n\"He got this old bass fiddle out, started slapping it, with a shuffle beat, and showed me the basic three notes you need on a little bass run to get started with,\" Lytle said in a 2011 radio interview. \"I gave it a try and I said, 'Hell, I can do that.'\"\nHaley's band changed their name to Bill Haley and the Comets in 1952, and Lytle played on memorable tracks including \"Crazy, Man, Crazy\" and \"Shake, Rattle and Roll.\" The bassist developed a lively stage presence, throwing his bass into the air, lifting it over his shoulder and riding it like a horse. The group landed their biggest hit in 1955 after a version of their classic recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" appeared in the opening credits of the movie Blackboard Jungle.\nLytle and two other band members left Bill Haley and the Comets in 1955 after a salary dispute, branching off into their own group, the Jodimars. The band would become a popular Las Vegas lounge act. Lytle changed his name to Tommy Page in the 1960s at the suggestion of a booking agent, who said his name was too closely connected to his stint with Bill Haley and the Comets.\nThough Haley died in 1981, Lytle and other Comets reunited in 1987 and performed off and on until 2009. Lytle, along with other Comets, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year.\nLytle was born on September 1st, 1933, in Old Fort, North Carolina, before his father moved the family to Pennsylvania.",

He is little known today compared to Berry, Presley, Little Richard, and the other early kings of rock and roll, for whom he helped cut a path. But \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d has remained intermittently iconic. It\u2019s a youthful grandfather to any number of rock party anthems: \u201cRock and Roll Music,\u201d \u201cRock and Roll All Nite,\u201d \u201cI Love Rock and Roll.\u201d And when something of the early rebellious rock spirit is sought, it\u2019s Haley\u2019s record that people often reach for. In 1987, LL Cool J tied his hip hop to rock and roll by egging on his d.j.\u2014\u201cGo Cut Creator Go\u201d\u2014instead of that noted guitarist Johnny B. Goode, and by kicking off the track with \u201cOne, two, THREE o\u2019clock, four o\u2019clock ROCK!\u201d\n\u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d climbed to number one in large part because it was the theme music to \u201cBlackboard Jungle,\u201d the 1955 Glenn Ford film that linked rock and roll to a whole range of juvenile delinquencies, from the smashing of jazz albums to attempted rape. During a nineteen-fifties revival, nearly twenty years later, \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d was chosen to be the first track on the \u201cAmerican Graffiti\u201d soundtrack, was the theme song for the first two seasons of \u201cHappy Days\u201d and, in 1974, briefly returned to the Billboard Top 40.

He was 79. According to The New York Times, Lytle died of lung cancer.\nLytle was a teenage guitar player working at a Chester, Pennsylvania, radio station when Haley, who worked at another station, recruited him to play bass. Lytle notably didn't play the instrument, but Haley taught him the rudiments of slap-bass in a 30-minute session. The technique was key for country music, which was the focus of Haley's band \u2013 then known as Bill Haley and His Saddlemen.\n\"He got this old bass fiddle out, started slapping it, with a shuffle beat, and showed me the basic three notes you need on a little bass run to get started with,\" Lytle said in a 2011 radio interview. \"I gave it a try and I said, 'Hell, I can do that.'\"\nHaley's band changed their name to Bill Haley and the Comets in 1952, and Lytle played on memorable tracks including \"Crazy, Man, Crazy\" and \"Shake, Rattle and Roll.\" The bassist developed a lively stage presence, throwing his bass into the air, lifting it over his shoulder and riding it like a horse. The group landed their biggest hit in 1955 after a version of their classic recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" appeared in the opening credits of the movie Blackboard Jungle.\nLytle and two other band members left Bill Haley and the Comets in 1955 after a salary dispute, branching off into their own group, the Jodimars. The band would become a popular Las Vegas lounge act. Lytle changed his name to Tommy Page in the 1960s at the suggestion of a booking agent, who said his name was too closely connected to his stint with Bill Haley and the Comets.\nThough Haley died in 1981, Lytle and other Comets reunited in 1987 and performed off and on until 2009. Lytle, along with other Comets, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year.\nLytle was born on September 1st, 1933, in Old Fort, North Carolina, before his father moved the family to Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen Big Joe Turner, a blues shouter who had an R. & B. hit with the song, sings the same line, we see something different.\nHaley died in 1981, at the age of fifty-five, a year or so before John Swenson published his biography, \u201cBill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll_._\u201d The Stray Cats were about to become famous by updating much of Haley\u2019s sound. He is little known today compared to Berry, Presley, Little Richard, and the other early kings of rock and roll, for whom he helped cut a path. But \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d has remained intermittently iconic.

During a nineteen-fifties revival, nearly twenty years later, \u201cRock Around the Clock\u201d was chosen to be the first track on the \u201cAmerican Graffiti\u201d soundtrack, was the theme song for the first two seasons of \u201cHappy Days\u201d and, in 1974, briefly returned to the Billboard Top 40.

A good data management system will ensure that no babies are lost to follow-up, as well as help ensure the quality of your program.\nStatewide tracking and surveillance\nThe Washington State Department of Health (DOH), in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), developed a statewide EHDDI Tracking and Surveillance system linked to the metabolic screening system. The tracking and surveillance system helps to ensure that all babies are screened for hearing loss prior to one month of age, those that are referred receive diagnostic audiological evaluation by 3 months of age, and those that are diagnosed with hearing loss receive early intervention by 6 months of age.\nWhile Washington state does not mandate universal newborn hearing screening, about 96% of infants are screened before hospital discharge. All birthing hospitals (except two military facilities) and many clinics in Washington report newborn hearing screening results and diagnostic results to EHDDI.\nThe EHDDI program collaborates with the Early Support for Infants and Toddlers (ESIT) program to determine if infants with hearing loss receive appropriate and timely early intervention services. The ESIT program is Washington state's Part C program that provides services to children birth to 3 years of age who have disabilities, including hearing loss. For updates on this project, please see the EHDDI program website and the ESIT website .\nFor more information about this project , please contact:\nWashington State Department of Health\n1610 NE 150th St.\nShoreline, WA 98155\nPhone: 206-418-5613 or 888-WAEHDDI (toll-free)\nData management for your hospital\nIt is important to have a system in place within your hospital to internally manage the data collected from your newborn hearing screening program. This will help you manage your workload and make sure that no babies are missed.\nMany larger programs prefer to purchase one of the commercially available software programs, while smaller programs often find simpler, less expensive options sufficient.\nWe recommend that all hospitals, regardless of size, keep a log sheet or book to manage daily screening needs. This helps ensure that all babies get screened prior to discharge.\nSample spreadsheet for data management (XLS)\nBefore choosing a data management option, you should consider what data you want to monitor and how much you want the system to do for you.",

(Jim) Walsh, US House Representative from 1989 \u2013 2009, was active in the passage of the first nationwide act that guaranteed hearing screenings for newborns and infants. In 1991, Walsh sponsored and introduced the Hearing Loss Testing Act. The Newborn and Infant Screening and Intervention Program Act was authored and sponsored, mainly, by Walsh in 1999. On March 11, 2009, the act was renamed as the James T. Walsh Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Program, and was identified within 42 United States Code 280g-1. The Act is for \u201cthe early detection, diagnosis, and treatment regarding hearing loss in newborns and infants,\u201d and included several provisions so that these endeavors would be accomplished.\nSince that time, Congress has expanded and reauthorized the original Act. Current legislation, known as the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act 2010, was approved and signed by President Obama on December 22, 2010.

The statement, published in the February 1999 issue of Pediatrics, discusses the justifications for universal hearing screening, tracking and follow-up, identification and intervention, evaluation, and other recommendations and issues. The AAP establishes parameters with the goal of ensuring that all newborns with hearing loss be identified.\n\u201cSignificant hearing loss is one of the most common major abnormalities present at birth and, if undetected, will impede speech, language and cognitive development,\u201d according to the policy statement. The average age for detection of significant hearing loss in the United States is less than 14 months, but the AAP would like to see all newborns screened before they leave the hospital so that treatment can be initiated before these infants are six months old. The policy states that about one to three per 1,000 infants in well-baby nurseries have significant loss of hearing in both ears, and about two to four per 100 infants in the intensive care unit have hearing loss.\nThe following five essential elements for an effective screening program were identified by the AAP: initial screening with a test having a high degree of sensitivity and specificity; tracking and follow-up; identification; intervention; and evaluation. Guidelines for each of the five essential elements are discussed in the statement. The following guidelines have been excerpted from the section of the guidelines that discusses identification and intervention in a universal neonatal hearing screening program:\nThe goal of universal screening is that 100 percent of infants with significant congenital hearing loss be identified by three months of age, and appropriate and necessary intervention be initiated by six months of age.\nAppropriate and necessary care for the infant with significant hearing loss should be directed and coordinated by the child's physician within the medical home, with support from appropriate ancillary services.\nA regionalized approach to identification and intervention for infants with significant hearing loss is essential, ensuring access for all children with significant hearing loss to appropriate expert services. The AAP recognizes that professionals with competency in this area may not be available in every community. The child's physician, working with the state department of health, must ensure that every infant with significant hearing loss is referred to the appropriate professionals within the regionalized system.",

The inquirer also sought guidance on the applicable evaluation timelines and required protocols.\nIn answering the writer\u2019s questions, OSEP explains in concise detail what the IDEA requires. Included in the discussion is the need for parental consent before evaluating a child suspected of having a disability or developmental delay, what that evaluation must involve (including a family-directed assessment to identify the family\u2019s resources, priorities, and concerns and the supports and services necessary), andhow each state\u2019s policies are a factor to be considered. The letter also answers questions such as:\nMay a previous hearing screening (such as a newborn hearing screening outcome or a hearing screening result provided by an Early Head Start program or a health care provider) meet the Part C evaluation requirements?\nHow can Part C programs ensure that a hearing screening or evaluation is completed in a timely manner when a child is determined to be eligible for Part C services based on an established condition?\nIf an initial evaluation has begun and the child requires treatment to resolve any temporary medical conditions before the hearing evaluation can be completed, how should Part C programs ensure that the child remains actively in the eligibility determination process if the hearing evaluation requires more than 45 days to complete?\nThe 4-page Dear Colleague letter is available in PDF, at:\nSOURCE ARTICLE: Center for Parent Information and Resources\nGive us a call at (727) 523-1130 or (800) 825-5736 or request a callback by clicking below.",

        "passage": "Hearing screening of newborns is a prerequisite for the early intervention and support needed by hearing impaired children. Early intervention is beneficial for the children's speech, educational, social and emotional development.\nThis has always been the main argument in favour of the universal newborn hearing screening programmes, first implemented in the 1990's and still being introduced around the world. Uruguay is among the countries currently preparing to offer hearing screening of all newborns. The first reports about the long-term effects of these programmes have been issued. They conclude that hearing screening works as advertised.\nVlandern: 85 percent in mainstream schools\nIn the Vlandern region of Belgium, all newborns have been hearing screened since 1998. The vast majority of newborns found to have hearing loss in screenings between 1998 and 2003 made it into mainstream schools, according to a recent evaluation of these children's speech and educational development.\n85 percent of the children five and a half years of age or older and with no other disability than hearing loss go to mainstream schools. Among those, whose hearing loss was treated with a cochlear implant, 79 percent attend mainstream schools.\nThe researchers behind this study concluded that early intervention in hearing impaired children may improve language outcomes and subsequent school and occupational performance.\nUSA: Screening benefits speech development\nIn the United States, hearing screenings became common practice following a recommendation made by the US Preventive Services Task Force in 2001. By 2006, 46 of the 50 states had hearing screening programmes.\nA new report, based on a survey of scientific articles about hearing screening, published since 2002, confirmed that children with hearing loss who had universal newborn hearing screening have better language outcome at school age than those not screened.\nIn particular, the ability to listen and understand speech is supported by early intervention following hearing screening. Children whose hearing loss was identified early, and children who had hearing screenings as newborns were found at 8 years of age to be better at listening and understanding speech than those whose hearing loss was discovered late and children who had not been hearing screened.

    "final_prompt": "\nBelow you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. \nPlease review the following texts carefully. \nWhile the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.\n\n---Begin Context---\nData Management and Quality Assurance\nManaging your program's data is crucial to ensuring the success and quality of your newborn hearing screening program. A good data management system will ensure that no babies are lost to follow-up, as well as help ensure the quality of your program.\nStatewide tracking and surveillance\nThe Washington State Department of Health (DOH), in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), developed a statewide EHDDI Tracking and Surveillance system linked to the metabolic screening system. The tracking and surveillance system helps to ensure that all babies are screened for hearing loss prior to one month of age, those that are referred receive diagnostic audiological evaluation by 3 months of age, and those that are diagnosed with hearing loss receive early intervention by 6 months of age.\nWhile Washington state does not mandate universal newborn hearing screening, about 96% of infants are screened before hospital discharge. All birthing hospitals (except two military facilities) and many clinics in Washington report newborn hearing screening results and diagnostic results to EHDDI.\nThe EHDDI program collaborates with the Early Support for Infants and Toddlers (ESIT) program to determine if infants with hearing loss receive appropriate and timely early intervention services. The ESIT program is Washington state's Part C program that provides services to children birth to 3 years of age who have disabilities, including hearing loss. For updates on this project, please see the EHDDI program website and the ESIT website .\nFor more information about this project , please contact:\nWashington State Department of Health\n1610 NE 150th St.\nShoreline, WA 98155\nPhone: 206-418-5613 or 888-WAEHDDI (toll-free)\nData management for your hospital\nIt is important to have a system in place within your hospital to internally manage the data collected from your newborn hearing screening program. This will help you manage your workload and make sure that no babies are missed.\nMany larger programs prefer to purchase one of the commercially available software programs, while smaller programs often find simpler, less expensive options sufficient.\nWe recommend that all hospitals, regardless of size, keep a log sheet or book to manage daily screening needs. This helps ensure that all babies get screened prior to discharge.\nSample spreadsheet for data management (XLS)\nBefore choosing a data management option, you should consider what data you want to monitor and how much you want the system to do for you.\n\nIn Texas, newborn hearing screening was mandated in 1999 through the passage of House Bill 714. In 2011 the mandate was expanded through House Bill 411 and Senate Bill 229. The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is the oversight agency.\nJames T. (Jim) Walsh, US House Representative from 1989 \u2013 2009, was active in the passage of the first nationwide act that guaranteed hearing screenings for newborns and infants. In 1991, Walsh sponsored and introduced the Hearing Loss Testing Act. The Newborn and Infant Screening and Intervention Program Act was authored and sponsored, mainly, by Walsh in 1999. On March 11, 2009, the act was renamed as the James T. Walsh Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Program, and was identified within 42 United States Code 280g-1. The Act is for \u201cthe early detection, diagnosis, and treatment regarding hearing loss in newborns and infants,\u201d and included several provisions so that these endeavors would be accomplished.\nSince that time, Congress has expanded and reauthorized the original Act. Current legislation, known as the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act 2010, was approved and signed by President Obama on December 22, 2010. In 2015, the US House of Representatives proposed amended legislation to reauthorize a program for early detection, diagnosis, and treatment regarding deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, and young children.\n\nAm Fam Physician. 1999 Sep 1;60(3):1020.\nThe Task Force on Newborn and Infant Hearing of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued a new policy statement recommending development of universal newborn hearing screening programs nationwide. The statement, published in the February 1999 issue of Pediatrics, discusses the justifications for universal hearing screening, tracking and follow-up, identification and intervention, evaluation, and other recommendations and issues. The AAP establishes parameters with the goal of ensuring that all newborns with hearing loss be identified.\n\u201cSignificant hearing loss is one of the most common major abnormalities present at birth and, if undetected, will impede speech, language and cognitive development,\u201d according to the policy statement. The average age for detection of significant hearing loss in the United States is less than 14 months, but the AAP would like to see all newborns screened before they leave the hospital so that treatment can be initiated before these infants are six months old. The policy states that about one to three per 1,000 infants in well-baby nurseries have significant loss of hearing in both ears, and about two to four per 100 infants in the intensive care unit have hearing loss.\nThe following five essential elements for an effective screening program were identified by the AAP: initial screening with a test having a high degree of sensitivity and specificity; tracking and follow-up; identification; intervention; and evaluation. Guidelines for each of the five essential elements are discussed in the statement. The following guidelines have been excerpted from the section of the guidelines that discusses identification and intervention in a universal neonatal hearing screening program:\nThe goal of universal screening is that 100 percent of infants with significant congenital hearing loss be identified by three months of age, and appropriate and necessary intervention be initiated by six months of age.\nAppropriate and necessary care for the infant with significant hearing loss should be directed and coordinated by the child's physician within the medical home, with support from appropriate ancillary services.\nA regionalized approach to identification and intervention for infants with significant hearing loss is essential, ensuring access for all children with significant hearing loss to appropriate expert services. The AAP recognizes that professionals with competency in this area may not be available in every community. The child's physician, working with the state department of health, must ensure that every infant with significant hearing loss is referred to the appropriate professionals within the regionalized system.\n\n(2018, December 20) | Useful to early interventionists, lead agencies, and Parent Centers on screening during evaluation of an infant or toddler for hearing loss or deafness.\nThis Dear Colleague letter from OSEP responds to a question about the evaluation process for an infant or toddler suspected of being deaf or hard of hearing to determine eligibility for early intervention services under Part C of IDEA. The inquirer also sought guidance on the applicable evaluation timelines and required protocols.\nIn answering the writer\u2019s questions, OSEP explains in concise detail what the IDEA requires. Included in the discussion is the need for parental consent before evaluating a child suspected of having a disability or developmental delay, what that evaluation must involve (including a family-directed assessment to identify the family\u2019s resources, priorities, and concerns and the supports and services necessary), andhow each state\u2019s policies are a factor to be considered. The letter also answers questions such as:\nMay a previous hearing screening (such as a newborn hearing screening outcome or a hearing screening result provided by an Early Head Start program or a health care provider) meet the Part C evaluation requirements?\nHow can Part C programs ensure that a hearing screening or evaluation is completed in a timely manner when a child is determined to be eligible for Part C services based on an established condition?\nIf an initial evaluation has begun and the child requires treatment to resolve any temporary medical conditions before the hearing evaluation can be completed, how should Part C programs ensure that the child remains actively in the eligibility determination process if the hearing evaluation requires more than 45 days to complete?\nThe 4-page Dear Colleague letter is available in PDF, at:\nSOURCE ARTICLE: Center for Parent Information and Resources\nGive us a call at (727) 523-1130 or (800) 825-5736 or request a callback by clicking below.\n\nHearing screening of newborns is a prerequisite for the early intervention and support needed by hearing impaired children. Early intervention is beneficial for the children's speech, educational, social and emotional development.\nThis has always been the main argument in favour of the universal newborn hearing screening programmes, first implemented in the 1990's and still being introduced around the world. Uruguay is among the countries currently preparing to offer hearing screening of all newborns. The first reports about the long-term effects of these programmes have been issued. They conclude that hearing screening works as advertised.\nVlandern: 85 percent in mainstream schools\nIn the Vlandern region of Belgium, all newborns have been hearing screened since 1998. The vast majority of newborns found to have hearing loss in screenings between 1998 and 2003 made it into mainstream schools, according to a recent evaluation of these children's speech and educational development.\n85 percent of the children five and a half years of age or older and with no other disability than hearing loss go to mainstream schools. Among those, whose hearing loss was treated with a cochlear implant, 79 percent attend mainstream schools.\nThe researchers behind this study concluded that early intervention in hearing impaired children may improve language outcomes and subsequent school and occupational performance.\nUSA: Screening benefits speech development\nIn the United States, hearing screenings became common practice following a recommendation made by the US Preventive Services Task Force in 2001. By 2006, 46 of the 50 states had hearing screening programmes.\nA new report, based on a survey of scientific articles about hearing screening, published since 2002, confirmed that children with hearing loss who had universal newborn hearing screening have better language outcome at school age than those not screened.\nIn particular, the ability to listen and understand speech is supported by early intervention following hearing screening. Children whose hearing loss was identified early, and children who had hearing screenings as newborns were found at 8 years of age to be better at listening and understanding speech than those whose hearing loss was discovered late and children who had not been hearing screened. No difference was found between the two groups in terms of speech ability and language.\nSources: International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology; Pediatrics; www.infanthearing.org\n---End Context---\n\n--Question--\nWhat are the target timelines for infant hearing screening and intervention in Washington state?\n\nInstructions:\n- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.\n- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.\n\n--Response Rules--\n- Response should be a json with key 'answer'",
    "answer": "In Washington state, the target timelines for infant hearing screening and intervention are as follows: The initial hearing screening should occur before the infant is one month old. If the initial screening identifies a potential hearing loss, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation should be completed by three months of age. Intervention services should start by six months of age to support the communication and developmental needs of infants with hearing loss.",

The decision was taken to build a church on the spot where the Emperor was mortally wounded, and an architectural competition was held. The church was built between 1883 and 1907 and was officially called the Resurrection of Christ Church. The construction of the church was almost entirely funded by the Imperial family and thousands of private donators. Both the interior and exterior of the church is decorated with incredibly detailed mosaics, designed and created by the most prominent Russian artists of the day (V.M. Vasnetsov, M.V. Nesterov and M.A. Vrubel). Interestingly, despite the church\u2019s very obviously Russian aspect, its principle architect, Alfred Alexandrovich Parland, was not even Russian by birth, nor the winner of the competition. The design harks back to medieval Russian architecture in the spirit of romantic nationalism.\nThe church was closed for services in the 1930s, when the Bolsheviks went on an offensive against religion and destroyed churches all over the country. It remained closed and under restoration for over 30 years and was finally re-opened in 1997 in all its dazzling former glory.\nTranslations of the church\u2019s name vary between guidebooks and include The Church of the Savior on Blood, The Resurrection Church and The Church of the Resurrection of Christ.",

The candidates for this sought-after certificate need to demonstrate their competency associated with leading projects. Earning this certification requires meeting the certain training & experience requirements as well as passing one qualifying exam.\nPMI PMP: Target Audience and Prerequisites\nThe PMI PMP certification is an ideal option for those candidates who need more experience than the usual managers to progress in their careers. There are various requirements for this certificate. For starters, the applicants should have a four-year degree, experience of 36 months in leading a project, and 35 hours of PM training or education. Alternatively, these individuals need to acquire a high school diploma or an associate\u2019s degree. They should also have at least 60 months of experience in leading projects as well as a minimum of 35 hours of PM education or training, or holding the CAPM certification. Once you make sure that you meet the eligibility requirements, you can proceed with submitting the audit application confirming your background. You can send your completed audit form by regular postal mail or express courier service to the address indicated on the official webpage. If your application is approved, you will be able to schedule your exam appointment.\nPMI PMP: Exam Details and Topics\nThe PMP certification exam consists of 200 multiple-choice questions. There are 175 scored as well as 25 unscored questions. The students will have 230 minutes to complete all of them.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s crucial to double-check all information before submitting it in order to avoid delays or rejections.\nWhile the application process can be time-consuming and requires attention-to-detail in filling out each section accurately with supporting documents; once completed successfully sets up a candidate\u2019s eligibility status for taking their PMP certification exam!\nWhat to expect after you apply\nAfter submitting your PMP application, you can expect to receive an email from the Project Management Institute (PMI) within 5 business days. The email will confirm that your application has been received and provide instructions on how to proceed with scheduling your exam.\nNext, PMI will conduct a thorough audit of your application. While some applications are randomly selected for audit, others may be flagged due to inconsistencies or missing information. If audited, you\u2019ll receive an email notification requesting additional documentation such as proof of education and project management experience.\nOnce the audit is complete and all requirements have been met, you\u2019ll receive another email directing you to schedule your exam through Pearson VUE\u2019s website or by phone. You can choose whether to take the exam at a testing center or online via a remote proctoring service.\nIt\u2019s important to note that if there are any issues with your eligibility during the application process or after scheduling your exam, PMI reserves the right to cancel or reschedule it without refunding any fees paid.\nPatience is key when waiting for updates from PMI regarding your PMP certification journey. Keep in mind that they\u2019re processing thousands of applications each month so don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about the status of yours.\nHow to prepare for the exam\nPreparing for the PMP exam can be a daunting task, but with proper planning and execution, you can ace the test without any hassle. The first step towards preparation is to understand what areas are covered in the exam and how they are weighted.

        "passage": "In particular, a function can not set state. This is a very different way of thinking from imperative languages such as Java, where there are objects all over the place with state that gets changed by method calls.\nReferential transparency is a phrase from the functional programming world which means, basically, \"no side effects\". Side effects include reading any state which is not passed in as an argument or setting any state which is not part of what is passed back as an argument. If a function is referentially transparent, then a call to that function with a specific set of values as arguments will always return exactly the same value.\nWhen functions are composed into larger functions, it is easier to reason about them when they are referentially transparent and there are no side effects to worry about. Of course, in the real world it can be very useful to be able to store some state data, so how does one implement this functionality in a pure functional language?\nThe answer is Monads. This is described pretty well in a 1992 paper by Philip Wadler called \"Monads for functional programming\". Reading this paper helped me understand the motivation for monads. Monads provide a way to collect all those side effects into known locations in the program. When all of the side effects are collected into monads, the rest of the program (all of the non-monad parts) are still referentially transparent, so remain easier to compose. The side effects are still there, but because they are encapsulated by the monads, it is easier to deal with them.\nGroup TheoryWhen you read about monads, at some point you will come across a mention of Category Theory as the source of monads. Category Theory is pretty abstract, and you don't need to know it to understand monads. But monads are a mathematical concept, so digging into the math background of the concept could help solidify your understanding.\nAfter reading a bunch of stuff about Category Theory, I went back to Group Theory, which for our purposes you can think of as a special case of Category Theory. While reviewing groups, rings and fields, I stumbled across monoids, a term which I had not recalled from my readings in the field years ago. It's not quite the same thing as a monad, but because Group Theory is focused on transformations, I started thinking of monads as transformations, which I think helped my understanding of them.",

The abstract model of this distributed system uses a uniform access memory model in order to provide a global memory view. This, combined with explicit thread based concurrency and explicit representation of demand enables the trustable distribution of reactive systems across different systems. Since referential transparency is preserved, any pattern of distribution has no effect on the semantics of the functional program.

Even handy techniques such as currying tend to get overly complex if you want to handle all the possible downstream dataflow paths in a structured way.\nI (think I) know that monads are supposed to be a highly general way of addressing this problem, but it seems 99% of programmers (including me) have a really really hard time properly understanding the concept well enough that it would help make their code clearer, to them and others.\nThis is where I find the principles around network composability of Flow-based programming (FBP) shines so brightly.\nIt solves the composability problem in three basic ways:\n- It gives each input and output its own identity, in the form of ports.\n- It allows to define the data dependencies between these ports, instead of between functions.\n- It allows the setup of these dependencies to happen at any place in the program, which makes it easy to e.g. produce a list of all the connections, as e.g. a simple list of (outport, inport) tuples.\nThe second point above is significant, as it means data dependencies are defined at the level of data, not functions.\nTrying to define data dependencies by defining dependencies between functions, is a major impedance mismatch in my books, and what is causing the need for such complicated syntax in a lot of functional programming.\nFlow-based programs on the other hand, are so easy that they can be simplified to two main parts:\n- A list of processes (Somewhat the counterpart to functions in FP)\n- A list of connections between input- and output ports.",

        "passage": "What is Functional Programming?\nFirstly, Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which everything is bound using pure mathematical functions. It\u2019s a declarative programming approach. In contrast to an imperative style, which focuses on \u201chow to solve,\u201d it focuses on \u201cwhat to solve.\u201d Instead of statements, it uses expressions. A statement is executed to assign variables, but an expression is evaluated to create a value. In addition, Those functions have some unique characteristics.\nComponents of functional programming\n- Pure functions\n- Referential transparency\n- Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order\nWhat is a Pure Function?\nPure functions are normal functions with some characteristics :\n- Total / Not Partial\n- No Randomness\n- No Side Effects\n- Not Null\n- No Exception\n- No Mutation\nExample of Pure Function\ndef add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b\nExample of Not a Pure Function\ndef divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a / b\nThe \u2018divide\u2019 function passes all the parameters of being a pure function but if in case \u2018a\u2019 will be divided by 0, Then it will throw an exception which will make it not a pure function.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of Functional Programming\n- This programming aids in the effective resolution of difficulties.\n- It improves modularity.\n- It allows us to implement lambda calculus in order to solve complex problems\n- Some programming languages support nested functions so it improves the maintainability of the code\n- It reduces complex problems into simple pieces so that it will be easy to solve.\n- It\u2019s difficult to grasp for novices, hence it\u2019s not a beginner-friendly paradigm approach for new programmers.\n- Maintenance is difficult during the coding phase when the project size is large\n- Moreover, Reusability in Functional programming is a tricky task for developers\nFor further information on functional programming wait for the next blog\u2026\nFor more details please visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming",

Even handy techniques such as currying tend to get overly complex if you want to handle all the possible downstream dataflow paths in a structured way.\nI (think I) know that monads are supposed to be a highly general way of addressing this problem, but it seems 99% of programmers (including me) have a really really hard time properly understanding the concept well enough that it would help make their code clearer, to them and others.\nThis is where I find the principles around network composability of Flow-based programming (FBP) shines so brightly.\nIt solves the composability problem in three basic ways:\n- It gives each input and output its own identity, in the form of ports.\n- It allows to define the data dependencies between these ports, instead of between functions.\n- It allows the setup of these dependencies to happen at any place in the program, which makes it easy to e.g. produce a list of all the connections, as e.g. a simple list of (outport, inport) tuples.\nThe second point above is significant, as it means data dependencies are defined at the level of data, not functions.\nTrying to define data dependencies by defining dependencies between functions, is a major impedance mismatch in my books, and what is causing the need for such complicated syntax in a lot of functional programming.\nFlow-based programs on the other hand, are so easy that they can be simplified to two main parts:\n- A list of processes (Somewhat the counterpart to functions in FP)\n- A list of connections between input- and output ports.\n\nWhat is Functional Programming?\nFirstly, Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which everything is bound using pure mathematical functions. It\u2019s a declarative programming approach. In contrast to an imperative style, which focuses on \u201chow to solve,\u201d it focuses on \u201cwhat to solve.\u201d Instead of statements, it uses expressions. A statement is executed to assign variables, but an expression is evaluated to create a value. In addition, Those functions have some unique characteristics.\nComponents of functional programming\n- Pure functions\n- Referential transparency\n- Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order\nWhat is a Pure Function?\nPure functions are normal functions with some characteristics :\n- Total / Not Partial\n- No Randomness\n- No Side Effects\n- Not Null\n- No Exception\n- No Mutation\nExample of Pure Function\ndef add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b\nExample of Not a Pure Function\ndef divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a / b\nThe \u2018divide\u2019 function passes all the parameters of being a pure function but if in case \u2018a\u2019 will be divided by 0, Then it will throw an exception which will make it not a pure function.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of Functional Programming\n- This programming aids in the effective resolution of difficulties.\n- It improves modularity.\n- It allows us to implement lambda calculus in order to solve complex problems\n- Some programming languages support nested functions so it improves the maintainability of the code\n- It reduces complex problems into simple pieces so that it will be easy to solve.\n- It\u2019s difficult to grasp for novices, hence it\u2019s not a beginner-friendly paradigm approach for new programmers.\n- Maintenance is difficult during the coding phase when the project size is large\n- Moreover, Reusability in Functional programming is a tricky task for developers\nFor further information on functional programming wait for the next blog\u2026\nFor more details please visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\n---End Context---\n\n--Question--\nWhat is referential transparency in functional programming and what are its main benefits?\n\nInstructions:\n- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.\n- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.\n\n--Response Rules--\n- Response should be a json with key 'answer'",

This property allows for easier reasoning about code, better testability, and enables powerful optimizations like lazy evaluation and memoization.",

This causes shallow breathing, but people with Duchenne compensate for this over time, and can provide the body with adequate oxygen supply and adequate removal of carbon dioxide. During surgery or procedures, certain anesthetics may lead to increasingly shallow breathing. Too shallow of breathing (hypoventilation) may lead to low oxygen levels and high carbon dioxide levels.\nYour anesthesiologist may decide you will need supplemental oxygen during your procedure, but they must use caution. When extra or supplemental oxygen is given, this delicate balance is disturbed. The respiratory center may get the false impression that the body has enough oxygen and no longer needs to breathe. Without breathing, carbon dioxide can build to dangerous levels (called hypercapnia). If oxygen is required during surgery or medical procedures, the anesthesiologist must use caution and monitor you closely. They may also use non-invasive ventilation (i.e. BiPAP machine) during the procedure to ensure you are breathing adequately.\nDuring surgery, it is sometimes necessary to support your breathing due to anesthesia or muscle relaxants given during the procedure. Intubation involves putting a breathing tube (also known as an endotracheal tube) into your airway. This breathing tube is then connected to a breathing machine (respirator or ventilator). This machine will then either assist with your breathing or actually breath for you, depending on your pulmonary function, the length of the surgery, or the type of surgery.",

        "passage": "Underwater photography can prove to be much more difficult than taking a photo on dry land and many people may not realize the various challenges that come along with getting a good quality underwater photograph.\nBefore even attempting underwater photography you should be proficient in basic water safety whether you are in a pool or deep sea diving. If you are diving, you should be experienced at diving procedures because taking a photograph underneath the water can cause unplanned distractions and you want to have the experience needed in case something goes wrong. You should always put your safety first before photography.\nMany challenges lie underneath of the water. Various things can play a big role in how good of a photograph that you are able to get in the water. If you are diving deep down into the sea, you will notice that the deeper you go, the darker it gets and you will most likely need special lighting in order to catch the essence and the beauty of sea life. You will need to make sure that if your camera does not include a sufficient enough flash for deep sea photographing, you have another kind of light source such as a strobe light to carry with you, otherwise the photos may turn out cloudy and dark without much color depth to them.\nThe current also becomes stronger the deeper you go below sea level and this can cause extra pressure on camera equipment while also making it more difficult to hold the camera still to get the perfect photograph. Bubbles and fish swimming around can make that task even more difficult.\nIf you are planning on taking photos while deep sea diving, be sure to check and see how waterproof your camera is. Most cameras have a depth limit, meaning that once you go past a certain depth, such as 10 feet, the camera may not work any longer. This is something to consider before purchasing an underwater camera because you want a camera that will work at the depth you wish to photograph.\nPractice makes perfect. You may have to play around with various settings and lighting to get the perfect shot. You should try various angles with the objects you are trying to photograph. It is best to get up close and personal with the object to get the best quality photo whether it be a fish or colorful coral. Looking through your diving mask, the object may look closer to you than what it actually is through the camera lens, and it will take practice to figure out exactly how to shoot the best photos.\nBecome familiar with your camera before going underwater so that you know exactly how to get the settings that you need.",

We all know what a pain it can be to run out of film while trying to take photos underwater, even if you loaded new film before you take that first dive, you are still able to only take a specific number of photos before the film runs out. You have to then wait for the film to rewind and the camera to dry out before you can change the film rolls. With digital cameras, you don\u2019t have to worry about any of that and with a large enough memory storage used, you can take literally hundreds of photos before running out of room.\nAlso, with actual 35mm film, you have to wait for the film to be processed before you can look at the photos. If certain photos didn\u2019t turn out, you wasted your time and money getting it developed just to throw the photo in the trash. With a digital underwater camera, you have the ability to view the photos immediately to see if you need to retake it.

Water is 784 times denser than air. Because of this density, light is absorbed much more quickly. The first elements of light to be absorbed are the red and orange colors. The deeper you go or the farther into water that you shoot (distance to subject), the more pronounced is the color loss.\nThis color loss creates a problem for the logic within the camera. When shot in auto mode, the camera will \u201cguess\u201d wrong every time. The beautiful blue water colors come out as a light powder blue or green.\nAdditionally, there is a mismatch between our human visual system and the capture system of the camera. Our eyes and brains are very adept at auto white balancing the colors we see\u2014even as we look up, down, close and far away. The white balance for each of these views is different underwater, but our brains seamlessly adjust them, so we don\u2019t see the same way the camera \u201csees.\u201d\nWe compared the cameras by setting them to auto mode and also several different shooting modes based upon lighting, location or subject, such as underwater mode. We followed our mermaid out to sea so that we could capture some beautiful vistas.\nUsing Preset Shooting Modes Underwater\nMode settings create a combination of adjustments that are predesigned for specific conditions. Some of the cameras we used had underwater modes. These modes are well worth experimenting with and using. Of course, there is always the issue of selecting and using the proper setting. Many times we forget what setting is active, which can actually make the image worse.\nUsing Manual Settings Underwater\nAnother mode that is frequently used is cloudy mode. When using \u201ccloudy,\u201d you are tricking the camera. On a cloudy day, sunlight is absorbed by the clouds much like it is absorbed by the water. The colors come out bluer and cooler because the clouds filter out the reds and oranges of the sunlight. The cloudy setting adds reds and oranges back into the photo, which is exactly what we also want to do with underwater photos.\nIn addition to preset shooting modes, some cameras provide manual adjustments. These include manual white balance adjustments to improve photos.\nManual Mode Camera Settings for Underwater Shooting\nManual mode allows the shooter to adjust ISO, f/stop and shutter speed.",

If you are diving, you should be experienced at diving procedures because taking a photograph underneath the water can cause unplanned distractions and you want to have the experience needed in case something goes wrong. You should always put your safety first before photography.\nMany challenges lie underneath of the water. Various things can play a big role in how good of a photograph that you are able to get in the water. If you are diving deep down into the sea, you will notice that the deeper you go, the darker it gets and you will most likely need special lighting in order to catch the essence and the beauty of sea life. You will need to make sure that if your camera does not include a sufficient enough flash for deep sea photographing, you have another kind of light source such as a strobe light to carry with you, otherwise the photos may turn out cloudy and dark without much color depth to them.\nThe current also becomes stronger the deeper you go below sea level and this can cause extra pressure on camera equipment while also making it more difficult to hold the camera still to get the perfect photograph. Bubbles and fish swimming around can make that task even more difficult.\nIf you are planning on taking photos while deep sea diving, be sure to check and see how waterproof your camera is. Most cameras have a depth limit, meaning that once you go past a certain depth, such as 10 feet, the camera may not work any longer. This is something to consider before purchasing an underwater camera because you want a camera that will work at the depth you wish to photograph.\nPractice makes perfect. You may have to play around with various settings and lighting to get the perfect shot. You should try various angles with the objects you are trying to photograph. It is best to get up close and personal with the object to get the best quality photo whether it be a fish or colorful coral. Looking through your diving mask, the object may look closer to you than what it actually is through the camera lens, and it will take practice to figure out exactly how to shoot the best photos.\nBecome familiar with your camera before going underwater so that you know exactly how to get the settings that you need.\n\nCoral taken with camera lens on a Iphone 12\nExploring Underwater camera\nFor those reefers who love to explore more in-depth and would like to take better quality photos, investing in an underwater camera would provide you the nearest take that you can find inside your reef tank. Yes , i mean inside your tank, as these underwater camera, for example, the popular Olympus TG series is able to submerge fully into the water for your underwater photograph.\nNot only does a underwater camera allow me to take pictures underwater ,it also has varies function that allow better photography underwater, for example the white balance setting allows user to auto-filter the blue light effect .\nFor those using Olympus TG camera, i am going to share with you some tricks how to set the auto white balance easily .\nFirstly, point your camera to a clear white surface that has blue light background. Alternatively, You can also find place a white acrylic plate in the tank for the camera to be able to set the auto white balance. Press \u201cCapture WB (Menu)\u201d and save the setting!\nSetting the auto white balance function\nAnd thank god you only need to set this once, and the next time you take pictures with your camera, you can quickly select the filter effect and start taking imdiately.\nThe image on the left is taken with an auto white balance function, and the image is taken without the white balance function\nOther than being able to take photo underwater, some of the underwater camera has a macro shot mode which enable you to take up close up shot of your corals enabling you to see all the fine details of all the colors /polyps ect .\nTips for Reef photography\nNow we have suggested ways that prevent your photos that get too \u201cBlue\u201d , the next thing that affects your picture quality is the glass wall barrier that come between you and the corals that could affect the image quality. Subject to the thickness of the glass, the pictures you take might tend to be blurry and not focused even when you are using a good camera. So below are some trips you can use to improve your photography.\n- place your camera as close as possible to the glass or even touching it so that the autofocus function of the camera is not detecting the glass as the \u201d Object\u201d.\n- If you do not have any camera lens or filter, adjust your lighting to warm white or a more natural white lighting. 12k and 14k lighting is good for photography.\n\nThe most important adjustments to make for underwater photography are fixing the white balance and balancing skin tones \u2013 it usually takes some experimentation, but you can get great results by just using Lightroom.\nMy favorite techniques for this are to use the white balance eye dropper tool in the Basic panel to choose a color that should be close to neutral gray, then adjusting the hue and saturation of each individual color with in the HSL panel.\nThen it is just a matter of tweaking the contrast and dynamic range.

    "answer": "To take clearer photos underwater, you can experiment with different shooting modes such as underwater mode or cloudy mode, which can help adjust for the color loss due to water density. Additionally, using manual settings to adjust ISO, f/stop, and shutter speed can provide more control over the image quality. It's also important to understand that the camera's auto mode may not accurately capture colors underwater, so manually setting the white balance can improve photo clarity.",

Chitosan is obtained from partial deacetylation of chitin which is removal of acetyl groups (-CH3CO) on N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) units of chitin polymer to reveal amino groups (-NH2) (as shown in Figure 1).\nFigure 1: De-acetylation of chitin to obtain chitosan, acetyl group (-CH3CO) on acetyl glucosamine monomer on chitin chain is removed to reveal amino group (-NH2) becoming glucosamine monomer making chitosan.\nIt is a long chain carbohydrate that is non-soluble in water but dissolves in most acids, and contains positively charged moieties. Possessing properties such as non-toxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, chitosan has been studied for its application in many sectors such as industrial wastewater treatment, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, agriculture, and biomedical use. Chitosan is a weak base and is insoluble in water and in organic solvent. However, it is soluble in dilute aqueous acidic solutions (PH<6.5), which can convert glucosamine units into soluble form R-NH3.",

The \"Guam Water Kids\" materials emphasize the importance of Guam's fresh water as a key resource, explain hydrological concepts, and introduce a sense of stewardship for conserving and protecting Guam's fresh water. These materials include a pre-recorded presentation, teacher's lesson plans and suggested activities, a Chamorro language glossary, and a companion website. The educational materials are correlated to learning standards recognized by the Guam Department of Education and have been approved for use in Guam public schools by the superintendent's office and announced in the GDOE newsletter. The materials were developed, in part, to support outreach efforts by WERI. There is a need to familiarize teachers with the materials and demonstrate the value of incorporating them into curriculum. Working directly with these educators will also increase awareness of WERI as a resource for water related issues and will open opportunities for WERI to engage educators in the future. As materials are employed and as teachers become engaged in water resource issues, an evaluation is needed to assess the effectiveness of the \"Guam Water Kids\" materials and to explore additional needs teachers may report such as a willingness to participate in water related courses for educators which may be developed in the future.\nSpecifically, we intend to follow the public schools' chain of approval, schedule a presentation targeted to reaching the 5th graders at each of the 6 elementary schools and follow the presentations with an evaluation by educators involved in teaching subjects related to water resource issues. Procedures include: 1) contact and present materials to the principals at each of the six elementary schools in the Guam public school system for approval at the school level.",

The \"Guam Water Kids\" materials emphasize the importance of Guam's fresh water as a key resource, explain hydrological concepts, and introduce a sense of stewardship for conserving and protecting Guam's fresh water. These materials include a pre-recorded presentation, teacher's lesson plans and suggested activities, a Chamorro language glossary, and a companion website. The educational materials are correlated to learning standards recognized by the Guam Department of Education and have been approved for use in Guam public schools by the superintendent's office and announced in the GDOE newsletter. The materials were developed, in part, to support outreach efforts by WERI. There is a need to familiarize teachers with the materials and demonstrate the value of incorporating them into curriculum. Working directly with these educators will also increase awareness of WERI as a resource for water related issues and will open opportunities for WERI to engage educators in the future. As materials are employed and as teachers become engaged in water resource issues, an evaluation is needed to assess the effectiveness of the \"Guam Water Kids\" materials and to explore additional needs teachers may report such as a willingness to participate in water related courses for educators which may be developed in the future.\nSpecifically, we intend to follow the public schools' chain of approval, schedule a presentation targeted to reaching the 5th graders at each of the 6 elementary schools and follow the presentations with an evaluation by educators involved in teaching subjects related to water resource issues. Procedures include: 1) contact and present materials to the principals at each of the six elementary schools in the Guam public school system for approval at the school level.\n\nUpon principal's approval, contact appropriate head teacher and schedule presentation to all fifth grade sections to be conducted in the spring 2010 and fall 2010 semesters; 2) conduct six team presentations of the \"Guam Water Kids\" program led by Ann Card and with WERI professionals serving as resource persons. Leave participating teachers with a packet of the educational materials including the CD presentation, printed copies of the two related Lesson Plans and Activities, and WERI contact information as appropriate; 3) conduct a survey of participating educators to evaluate the \"Guam Water Kids\" presentation and related lesson plans. Include additional questions about needs teachers may have and specifically poll interest in participating in future teacher training courses in water resources, a critical need which has been identified by the advisory council. The survey will be conducted online with an \"on paper\" option in order to facilitate participation. Contact information will be preserved in order to facilitate future communication with educators; 4) analyze and report survey results; 5) make any appropriate adjustments to existing \"Guam Water Kids\" materials indicated by educators' assessments.\nProgress/Completion Report, 2010, PDF\n\nNew curriculum aimed to combat child abuse\nOf more than 700 people listed on Guam\u2019s sex offender registry, more than 80 percent are listed for sexually assaulting a child.\nIn response to the high rate of sexual assault committed against children, several of the island\u2019s government agencies and nonprofit organizations have come together to combat the trend.\nFor its population, Guam has one of the highest rates of rape in the nation.\nIn 2013, the most recent year for which statistics are available, the Guam Police Department received 106 reports of forcible rape. That gave the island a rate of about 64.2 reported rapes per 100,000 people.\nThe national rate, according to FBI crime statistics for the same year, was about 25.2 reported rapes per 100,000 people.\nOf the 50 states, only Alaska, with a rate of 87.6 reported rapes per 100,000 people, had a higher rate than Guam.\nThe island\u2019s sex offender registry was created in 1999 by the 25th Guam Legislature.\nLocal law requires the names of those convicted of sex crimes be placed on the registry along with their photograph and description as well as the date and place of their conviction.\nAs of this week, the sex offender registry included 752 individuals. Close to three-quarters of them are registered for life.\nIn 2011, the governor signed into law the \u201cLaniKate Protehi Y Famagu\u2019on-ta Act,\u201d which created the LaniKate task force.\nThe task force included members from various government agencies and nonprofit organizations and was tasked with developing opportunities to prevent child sexual abuse in Guam.\nOne of the task force\u2019s mandates was to create age-appropriate curriculum for students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade.\nThis past summer, Attorney General Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson and Deputy Attorney General Carol Hinkle-Sanchez attended a three-day program in Honolulu.\nThere, they learned to train others here in Guam and implement the curriculum as mandated by the 2011 law.\nFor the past several months, they have been training educators about the curriculum and are prepared to roll the program out in March, Hinkle-Sanchez said Wednesday.\nHinkle-Sanchez is deputy attorney general for the office\u2019s juvenile division.\nAlthough only mandated to put the curriculum in elementary schools, Hinkle-Sanchez said it will cover all grade levels.\nThe program is divided into four levels, each of which is designed for a particular age range.\n\nThe \u201c2010 Census in Schools: It\u2019s About Us\u201d program was introduced to kindergarten through 12th grade principals in the United States, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Marianas Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands in a letter in April.\nThe program is designed to provide students in grades K-12 with information about the importance of the 2010 Census.\nThe Census Bureau hopes students will share this information with their adult household members and they, in turn, will answer the census questionnaire.\nThe federal government conducts a census every 10 years to collect information about the people and housing of the United States.\nThe Census Bureau will send Census in Schools program brochures to all grade 9 through 12 principals, social studies department chairs and school service coordinators this summer.\nThe Census in Schools program will offer:\n- Age-specific educational materials, which include maps displaying population counts and other demographic information, and lesson plans grouped by grade and correlated to national standards for math, geography and language arts.\n- Kits for principals, containing maps, a program brochure, information about online lessons, mini-teaching guides and family take-home kits.\n- Online resources for teachers, including lesson plans, family take-home kits, event ideas and census data to teach students and their families about the census\u2019 role in American history, current events and more.\nThe interactive, user-friendly Census in Schools Web site features memory games, word finds, state facts, coloring pages and research project ideas.\nAll \u201c2010 Census in Schools: It\u2019s All About Us\u201d program materials will be available online for educators, students, parents and the public in August.\n\nThe Micronesian Shark Foundation Shark Education Program is conducted in Palau jointly with the Palau Conservation Society's \u201cRidge to Reef\u201d school program.\nCooperation has been attempted with schools in Guam, Yap, Chuuk and Pohnpei. The Ridge to Reef program and it\u2019s equivalents throughout Micronesia is open to all 5th graders.\nAt the end of each program, a team of two from the Foundation talk with the students about the importance of sharks to our ecosystem. Tim, the Shark Ranger, conducts the presentation while Finny the funny shark, attired with a shark costume dances, hugs and shakes hands with the students. Most importantly, Finny brings huge smiles to the children's faces and a recognition that sharks are an important and vital part of the ecosystem and reefs.\nOur Micronesian Shark Foundation Team Finny the funny Shark and Tim the Shark Ranger have been to several schools throughout Micronesia and children have been very impressed by their performance and message. Micronesian Shark Foundation has organized painting competitions in visited schools and awarded winners with prizes. To leave a deeper mark in the kid's minds Finny the funny shark and Tim the Micronesian Shark Foundation Ranger had to appear on more frequent bases, at least 2 times a year.\nWhile Finny & Tim the foundations shark ranger are volunteers, books and prizes for children are expensive and we need funding for these programs - if you wish to fund one of our activities please click here.\n---End Context---\n\n--Question--\nWhat are the main educational materials included in the 'Guam Water Kids' program for students aged 9-12?\n\nInstructions:\n- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.\n- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.\n\n--Response Rules--\n- Response should be a json with key 'answer'",

IAI already had acquired expertise in resin transfer molding (RTM) during development of the 2.8m-long, one-piece composite rudder it now produces for the Gulfstream G250 business jet (see \u201cRTM showcase: One-Piece Rudder\u201d). \u201cWe know how to design parts for RTM,\u201d says Rosenfeld, \u201cbut now we wanted to automate the preforming as well.\u201d\nFor a test case, IAI selected an in-process composite helicopter cockpit seat. \u201cWe chose a helicopter seat because we already had this part designed in prepreg, so we could compare the weight and cost for parts made with prepreg and autoclave cure vs. the consolidated design using automated RTM.\u201d The resulting seat reduces cost by 30% vs. its prepreg predecessor while maintaining critical strength and crash performance, and shaving weight by 7%.\nPart and process design\nRosenfeld points out there is a strong relationship between the design of the automated production line and that of the part. \u201cThe part geometry was challenging with regard to creating the prepreg layup,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen you try to fold the prepreg material into a corner, it wants to wrinkle. So, you have to cut darts. But these reduce the strength of the part and you have to then compensate for this.\u201d RTM offered improvements by moving away from prepreg layup, but there were new considerations. Forming was still required, but using dry fabrics instead of prepregs improved drapeability, reducing the need for manipulations such as darts. The process was also amenable to automation, but Rosenfeld notes, \u201cwe had to keep in mind what a robot can do.\u201d\nA key aspect of composite aerostructures design is certification. \u201cWe must certify the part and the production line,\u201d says Rosenfeld. \u201cMost parts are certified together with the airplane they fly on.",

The RTM process is suitable for medium and big series production. The method consists of impregnating dry fibers (first cut and placed into the mold) with thermoset resin under pressure. RTM parts have accurate surface and high mechanical properties. This technology allows us to produce highly loaded parts with strict tolerances (for example, airplane engine parts).\nAdvantages and restrictions of the technology\nRTM technology requires the use of two-sided molds (punch and matrix). The high cost of mold production, together with a medium-level production rate, makes this technology expensive for part production. Nevertheless, this method is widely used in some industries because of its advantages:\n\u2013 The ability to produce complex, integrated parts with inserts, with sandwich structure (foam core) helps to shorten assembly time;\n\u2013 High accuracy (low tolerances) and almost no post-molding processing;\n\u2013 The ability to produce parts with a high thickness and complex shape, which is usually impossible with other methods;\n\u2013 The high mechanical properties and wear-resistance (lifetime) of produced parts, and low-porous surface;\n\u2013 Easily painted surface (up to Class A);\n\u2013 The quality is reproducible in big series manufacturing.\nDepending on the customer\u2019s needs, several types of reinforcing materials can be used: various fabrics and mats made of glass, carbon, organic or basalt fibers. Polyester or epoxy resins with low viscosity are usually used as a matrix material.\nRTM parts have smooth, accurate surfaces on all sides. This method offers wide design possibilities with a properly designed mold and careful preform preparation. The produced parts can have a complex profile, with different types of bosses, waves, different thickness and so on. The possibilities and restrictions of part design with RTM technology are described in detail in the table below.\nTable.

These processes however, offer limited freedom to locally reinforce structures. This paper describes an approach to utilise a basic geometry for several similar parts and add local reinforcement patches only in regions of load introduction or high local stress. The approach offers the benefit of being able to combine automated production methods with unprecedented design freedom. The specific bearing performance for three different local reinforcement using (1) add-on CFRP patches, (2) surface mounted steel foils and (3) steel foil interleaving in replacement of 90\u00b0 plies with foils of the same thickness as the CFRP plies (0.125 mm) is compared by double lap bearing tests. The bearing strength improves with the addition of patches, for surface mounted steel foils, more so as CFRP co-cured patches, and most as an interleaved configuration. Quasi ductile failure of the bearing joints was maintained due to additional plasticity of the steel foils, producing a joint that fails safely while enhancing the bearing strength. When examining the hybrid laminates, all samples buckled and failed in bearing compression/shear. Brooming was evident on the compressive side of the hole where the bolt indented the laminate. Indentation led to shear kink bands along the washer supported region and appear as large compression/shear damage above the washer confined region of the laminate. When normalised by weight, the three approaches show similar bearing performance. However, each approach has specific advantages with regards to processing, electrolytic potential, or absolute bearing strength, depending on the design of the load introduction.",

The specific bearing performance for three different local reinforcement using (1) add-on CFRP patches, (2) surface mounted steel foils and (3) steel foil interleaving in replacement of 90\u00b0 plies with foils of the same thickness as the CFRP plies (0.125 mm) is compared by double lap bearing tests. The bearing strength improves with the addition of patches, for surface mounted steel foils, more so as CFRP co-cured patches, and most as an interleaved configuration. Quasi ductile failure of the bearing joints was maintained due to additional plasticity of the steel foils, producing a joint that fails safely while enhancing the bearing strength. When examining the hybrid laminates, all samples buckled and failed in bearing compression/shear. Brooming was evident on the compressive side of the hole where the bolt indented the laminate. Indentation led to shear kink bands along the washer supported region and appear as large compression/shear damage above the washer confined region of the laminate. When normalised by weight, the three approaches show similar bearing performance. However, each approach has specific advantages with regards to processing, electrolytic potential, or absolute bearing strength, depending on the design of the load introduction.\n---End Context---\n\n--Question--\nWhat are the main advantages of using automated RTM (Resin Transfer Molding) over traditional prepreg manufacturing for aircraft seat structures?\n\nInstructions:\n- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.\n- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.\n\n--Response Rules--\n- Response should be a json with key 'answer'",
    "answer": "The main advantages of using automated RTM over traditional prepreg manufacturing for aircraft seat structures include cost reduction due to the adoption of automated production methods like pultrusion or resin transfer molding, which are designed for lightweight structures. Additionally, RTM offers unprecedented design freedom by allowing the combination of automated processes with local reinforcement patches only in regions of load introduction or high local stress, enhancing structural integrity and efficiency. This approach can maintain quasi-ductile failure of the bearing joints due to the additional plasticity of reinforcement materials, ensuring safe and enhanced bearing strength while optimizing weight and performance.",

      {
        "passage": "Agency analysts told InsideClimate News that Architecture 2030's report downplays factors that have nothing to do with making buildings greener like the huge slowdown in construction from the recession that means fewer buildings have been, and will get, built.\nFor the most part, though, EIA officials agree with the bottom line of Mazria's report that green improvements are saving energy. \"Over the years, our projections for buildings' energy consumption have decreased, and a lot of that is due to increases in efficiency,\" Erin Boedecker, the lead building analyst at EIA, said.\nThe Rise of the Green Building\nSince 2005, the federal government and most states have adopted various building codes and efficiency tax incentives that have helped spur a green-building boom.\nMost notably, a mandate under the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act requires all federal buildings to reduce energy use by 30 percent in 2015 compared to 2003 levels. In 2010, California passed the nation's first mandatory statewide green building code, which took effect last year. Meanwhile, more than half of all states have adopted the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code, a standard created by the International Code Council, a U.S.-based nonprofit, which requires buildings to meet efficiency standards for heating units and air conditioners, water heaters and lighting.\nAs a result of these and other policies, efficiency fixes such as energy-efficient lighting and appliances, insulation, tightly sealed windows and rooftop solar panels, have become common in new and renovated buildings. Green construction jumped from two percent of new non-residential buildings in 2005 to nearly 30 percent in 2010, according to the latest figures from McGraw Hill Construction, a publisher of construction information.\nMarket forces are also at play. While it can be expensive to make buildings energy efficient, the return on investment, mainly from avoided electricity or heating costs, is nearly 10 percent higher than from conventional buildings, according to McGraw Hill.\nGreen builders can also receive thousands in rebates and tax incentives from state governments, allowing them to recoup upfront costs even faster. An additional lure: A building with green features generally has higher value, occupancy rates and can fetch higher rents than it would otherwise.",

Everyone was talking about it.\u201d\nAs with the other parts of the real estate market, the collapse has dried up credit and put a virtual freeze on new green construction, at least in the private sector. Most capital expenditures are currently being devoted to retrofitting old buildings with green technologies, such as efficient sewage and storm drainage, heating and water systems.\nGreen REITs have not sprouted from this activity because it has been centred on either public or owner-occupied buildings, according to Pivo. He feels it could be up to five years before the market picks up enough to provide ample investment options in the SRI niche.\n\u201cI do think that when the real estate cycle is back into a growth phase that this certainly will be a hot topic,\u201d he says. \u201cI do eventually expect REITs to be branding themselves explicitly as SRI.\u201d\nRising investment in green construction and renovation leading up to the real estate market collapse supports this view. Between 2000 and 2004, for example, the estimated value of US green construction started to rise from $792 million to $4.51 billion, according to the US Green Building Council. The council projects that the total value could reach $60 billion in 2010.\nOverall, the green market represented between 10% and 12% of non-residential construction in 2008, up from 2% in 2005, according to the council. The share is projected to rise to between 20% and 25% by 2013. One large company with a big green footprint is Simon Property Group Incorporated, the largest public real estate company in the United States and considered one of the leaders in implementing energy-sustaining practices.",

        "passage": "A new study from McGraw Hill Construction suggests a number of reasons why builders should get up to speed on green building.\nFirst, the green building market is growing. According to a summary of the report, the green share of the single-family residential market has grown from 2% in 2005 to 23% in 2013 and should reach between 26% and 33% of the market by 2016. That would be worth as much as $105 billion.\nGreen building grew even during the recent recession. The overall housing market took a nosedive between 2005 and 2008, declining from a value of $315 billion to $122 billion. But the green housing market showed a healthy increase over the same period, from $6 billion in 2005 (2% of the market) to $10 billion (8% of the market) in 2008.\nOver the next few years, the industry bumped along, reaching a value of $97 billion by 2011. But green building continued a steady climb to reach $17 billion by 2011.\nBoth builders and remodelers see green growth ahead\nNew-home builders seem to be adopting green practices faster than remodelers. In five years, 62% of builders expect to be doing green on more than 60% of their projects, McGraw Hill reports, and 30% expect to be building green on more than 90% of their projects.\nBy 2018, the study says, 32% of remodelers expect that more than 60% of their projects will be green.\nFinally, many builders find customers are willing to pay more for green features.\n\u201cConsidering the economy, it is notable that over 68% of builders and 84% of remodelers report their customers are willing to pay more for green,\u201d the study says. \u201cBoth of these are an increase over the reported results from 2011 where 61% of builders and 66% of remodelers reported the same. The big jump for remodelers may be due to the improving economy and the increased awareness and accessibility to affordable green building products and practices.\u201d\nOn average, builders say consumers will pay 3% more for green homes and 5% more for green remodeling.\nMcGraw Hill said findings on the green home marketplace and other results from this study would be published in April in partnership with the National Association of Home Builders.",

        "passage": "These numbers are getting the attention of developers and driving the growth of eco-construction. Nationally, about 2% of today's new, nonresidential construction is considered green, estimates the MHC study. From last year's $3.3 billion, green office and retail construction is expected to surge by up to 10% a year, to $20 billion, by 2010.\nCosts Backing Down\nGiven New York's love affair with tall towers and the unmatched scale of the city's real estate market, it's no surprise that Manhattan is emerging as the epicenter of green high-rise construction. Bank of America's tower will be the greenest of a surge of eco-friendly office buildings sprouting up in midtown and near Wall Street.\nFirst to open was 7 World Trade Center, the start of new construction at Ground Zero. Next was Foster + Partners' stunning addition to Hearst's headquarters in midtown. And nearing completion just a few blocks west of Bank of America Tower on 42nd Street is Renzo Piano's New York Times Building.\nThe flurry of eco-construction reflects builders' growing confidence that the extra costs of building green are a good investment. The up front costs of building green are still higher than using conventional materials, but that premium is shrinking. Just a few years ago, green construction could cost 10% or more than standard construction.\nToday that margin has fallen into the range of single digits.

    "final_prompt": "\nBelow you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. \nPlease review the following texts carefully. \nWhile the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.\n\n---Begin Context---\nAgency analysts told InsideClimate News that Architecture 2030's report downplays factors that have nothing to do with making buildings greener like the huge slowdown in construction from the recession that means fewer buildings have been, and will get, built.\nFor the most part, though, EIA officials agree with the bottom line of Mazria's report that green improvements are saving energy. \"Over the years, our projections for buildings' energy consumption have decreased, and a lot of that is due to increases in efficiency,\" Erin Boedecker, the lead building analyst at EIA, said.\nThe Rise of the Green Building\nSince 2005, the federal government and most states have adopted various building codes and efficiency tax incentives that have helped spur a green-building boom.\nMost notably, a mandate under the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act requires all federal buildings to reduce energy use by 30 percent in 2015 compared to 2003 levels. In 2010, California passed the nation's first mandatory statewide green building code, which took effect last year. Meanwhile, more than half of all states have adopted the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code, a standard created by the International Code Council, a U.S.-based nonprofit, which requires buildings to meet efficiency standards for heating units and air conditioners, water heaters and lighting.\nAs a result of these and other policies, efficiency fixes such as energy-efficient lighting and appliances, insulation, tightly sealed windows and rooftop solar panels, have become common in new and renovated buildings. Green construction jumped from two percent of new non-residential buildings in 2005 to nearly 30 percent in 2010, according to the latest figures from McGraw Hill Construction, a publisher of construction information.\nMarket forces are also at play. While it can be expensive to make buildings energy efficient, the return on investment, mainly from avoided electricity or heating costs, is nearly 10 percent higher than from conventional buildings, according to McGraw Hill.\nGreen builders can also receive thousands in rebates and tax incentives from state governments, allowing them to recoup upfront costs even faster. An additional lure: A building with green features generally has higher value, occupancy rates and can fetch higher rents than it would otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe tangibility of the impact is very transparent,\u201d says David Wood, director of the Boston College Institute for Responsible Investment. \u201cWe think that will drive the market towards this type of investing.\u201d\nA Broad Collapse\nA discussion of green real estate investment would not be complete without turning to the elephant in the room: the collapse of the US residential and commercial US real estate markets.\nBefore the crisis, the green real estate sector was poised for growth, according to observers. \u201cIf we turn the clock back even two years, the tide was really building,\u201d says Steven Schueth, president of First Affirmative Financial Network LLC, an investment advisor in Colorado Springs, Colorado, that specialises in socially responsible investing. \u201cThat big wave was really building and green real estate was hot. Everyone was talking about it.\u201d\nAs with the other parts of the real estate market, the collapse has dried up credit and put a virtual freeze on new green construction, at least in the private sector. Most capital expenditures are currently being devoted to retrofitting old buildings with green technologies, such as efficient sewage and storm drainage, heating and water systems.\nGreen REITs have not sprouted from this activity because it has been centred on either public or owner-occupied buildings, according to Pivo. He feels it could be up to five years before the market picks up enough to provide ample investment options in the SRI niche.\n\u201cI do think that when the real estate cycle is back into a growth phase that this certainly will be a hot topic,\u201d he says. \u201cI do eventually expect REITs to be branding themselves explicitly as SRI.\u201d\nRising investment in green construction and renovation leading up to the real estate market collapse supports this view. Between 2000 and 2004, for example, the estimated value of US green construction started to rise from $792 million to $4.51 billion, according to the US Green Building Council. The council projects that the total value could reach $60 billion in 2010.\nOverall, the green market represented between 10% and 12% of non-residential construction in 2008, up from 2% in 2005, according to the council. The share is projected to rise to between 20% and 25% by 2013. One large company with a big green footprint is Simon Property Group Incorporated, the largest public real estate company in the United States and considered one of the leaders in implementing energy-sustaining practices.\n\nA new study from McGraw Hill Construction suggests a number of reasons why builders should get up to speed on green building.\nFirst, the green building market is growing. According to a summary of the report, the green share of the single-family residential market has grown from 2% in 2005 to 23% in 2013 and should reach between 26% and 33% of the market by 2016. That would be worth as much as $105 billion.\nGreen building grew even during the recent recession. The overall housing market took a nosedive between 2005 and 2008, declining from a value of $315 billion to $122 billion. But the green housing market showed a healthy increase over the same period, from $6 billion in 2005 (2% of the market) to $10 billion (8% of the market) in 2008.\nOver the next few years, the industry bumped along, reaching a value of $97 billion by 2011. But green building continued a steady climb to reach $17 billion by 2011.\nBoth builders and remodelers see green growth ahead\nNew-home builders seem to be adopting green practices faster than remodelers. In five years, 62% of builders expect to be doing green on more than 60% of their projects, McGraw Hill reports, and 30% expect to be building green on more than 90% of their projects.\nBy 2018, the study says, 32% of remodelers expect that more than 60% of their projects will be green.\nFinally, many builders find customers are willing to pay more for green features.\n\u201cConsidering the economy, it is notable that over 68% of builders and 84% of remodelers report their customers are willing to pay more for green,\u201d the study says. \u201cBoth of these are an increase over the reported results from 2011 where 61% of builders and 66% of remodelers reported the same. The big jump for remodelers may be due to the improving economy and the increased awareness and accessibility to affordable green building products and practices.\u201d\nOn average, builders say consumers will pay 3% more for green homes and 5% more for green remodeling.\nMcGraw Hill said findings on the green home marketplace and other results from this study would be published in April in partnership with the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nThese numbers are getting the attention of developers and driving the growth of eco-construction. Nationally, about 2% of today's new, nonresidential construction is considered green, estimates the MHC study. From last year's $3.3 billion, green office and retail construction is expected to surge by up to 10% a year, to $20 billion, by 2010.\nCosts Backing Down\nGiven New York's love affair with tall towers and the unmatched scale of the city's real estate market, it's no surprise that Manhattan is emerging as the epicenter of green high-rise construction. Bank of America's tower will be the greenest of a surge of eco-friendly office buildings sprouting up in midtown and near Wall Street.\nFirst to open was 7 World Trade Center, the start of new construction at Ground Zero. Next was Foster + Partners' stunning addition to Hearst's headquarters in midtown. And nearing completion just a few blocks west of Bank of America Tower on 42nd Street is Renzo Piano's New York Times Building.\nThe flurry of eco-construction reflects builders' growing confidence that the extra costs of building green are a good investment. The up front costs of building green are still higher than using conventional materials, but that premium is shrinking. Just a few years ago, green construction could cost 10% or more than standard construction.\nToday that margin has fallen into the range of single digits. As the market for green materials and design expertise has grown and matured, \"the supply of materials and services is going up and the price is coming down,\" says Taryn Holowka, communications manager at the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).\nWaterless Water Closets\nTo be sure, green projects can still throw up costly delays or surprising snafus.

For a horse this could be anything, including trailering and traveling, showing, poor nutrition, feeding at irregular times, changes in other routines, environmental toxins, interactions within their social environment, variations in climate, and illness.\nSome types of stress include various physical stresses that are based on the physical makeup of the animal and its ability to respond to changes in diet, injury, etc. Psychological stresses are based on a horse\u2019s personality and its perception of life. For example, some horses are more stressed than others by being in a stall for long periods of time.\nHow do Horses Cope with Stress?\nThe horse\u2019s basic stress response starts with a change in behavior, either by moving away from a stimulus, swishing its tail, bucking, tensing up, etc. This stress will then cause activation of the sympathetic nervous system, called the \u201cFight or Flight\u201d response. The sympathetic nervous system will create an involuntary action of the intestines (diarrhea), endocrine glands (production of adrenaline and cortisol), and heart (increase in heart rate). Next the neuroendocrine system will be activated, allowing the horse\u2019s system to increase its energy utilization.\nEach horse deals with stress in a different way depending on their personality.\nDemonstrative, Confident Horse\n\u2022 Lets you know when it is stressed!\n\u2022 Bucks, kicks, bites, is very curious, mouthy, a troublemaker, etc.\nDemonstrative, Fearful Horse\n\u2022 Worries about everything!\n\u2022 Shies the first time it sees things and needs time to relax.\nPassive, Confident Horse\n\u2022 Usually wonders, \u201cWhat\u2019s everyone worried about?\u201d\n\u2022 Not normally stressed, internalizes stress, shows little change even when stressed.\n\u2022 Usually is the last one in the field to take off running if something runs out of the woods.\nPassive, Fearful Horse\n\u2022 Wants to please!\n\u2022 Seems willing to do anything, but will tighten muscles and lips when stressed.\n\u2022 Won\u2019t show fear until pushed over the limit.\nDuring exercise heat production will increase up to 50 %. This can create a problem when exercising under extremely hot and humid conditions.",

Basically, if horses didn\u2019t get stressed sometimes, they would be more likely to get into tricky situations. However, the problem comes when horses are stressed for longer periods of time, without being able to get away from what is causing it. This is when stress begins to have damaging effects on your horse\u2019s body, including reduced immunity, inhibited performance and, in particular, gastric ulcers (EGUS).\nSo, how can you tell if your horse is stressed, what are the most common causes and what can do you do to help ensure your horse\u2019s stress levels are kept to a minimum for optimum health and performance?\nSigns of stress in horses\nWhen your horse is exposed to something than elicits a stress response, commonly known as a \u2018stressor\u2019, their body releases a hormone called cortisol which promotes behavioural and physiological changes that result in some common signs and symptoms of stress, including:\n- Vocalisation or \u2018whinnying\u2019\n- Tail Swishing\n- Reduction of appetite\n- Stereotypies e.g. crib biting or box walking\n- Flared nostrils\n- Elevated cortisol levels\n- Elevated heart rate\n- Gastric ulcers\nCauses of Stress in horses\nIf your horse shows any or a combination of these signs, then it is likely they are experiencing stress. Once you know your horse is potentially stressed, the best plan of action is to find out what is causing it and taking appropriate action to reduce stress levels.\nThere are many causes of stress linked to environment, routine and management but some of the most common ones include:\nJust as we can get stressed and fearful of performance, so can our horses. In addition, the noise, atmosphere and other horses at a competition or show are major stressors which can affect your horse. Research has shown that cortisol levels rise at competitions prior to performance in a range of disciplines and that higher or prolonged levels of stress negatively affect performance (Becker-Birk et al. 2013; Lewinski et al. 2013; Christensen et al. 2012).",

    "answer": "Horses can exhibit different personality types when responding to stress. Some may vocalize or whinny, showing distress through sound. Others might swish their tails more frequently than usual, indicating discomfort. A reduction in appetite can also be a sign, as stress can affect a horse's eating habits. More extreme behaviors, such as stereotypies like crib biting or box walking, might appear if stress is prolonged. Physically, elevated heart rates and flared nostrils can be observed, alongside increased cortisol levels which are markers of stress. Understanding these behavioral and physiological responses can help in identifying and addressing the sources of stress in horses for their well-being and performance.",

        "passage": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic genetic condition involving multiple organ systems. Classical CF primarily involves the respiratory and digestive systems, and may have a range of clinical severity. Pulmonary symptoms often include lower airway inflammation, chronic cough, chronic sinusitis, and recurrent infections. Digestive symptoms often include meconium ileus, pancreatic insufficiency resulting in malabsorption and/or failure to thrive, diabetes mellitus, and hepatobiliary disease. Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) is seen in men without pulmonary or digestive symptoms of CF, and results in azoospermia . CBAVD is a significant cause of male infertility.\nCF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Individuals with mutations in the CFTR gene may also present with milder or atypical symptoms such as pancreatitis or chronic sinusitis.\nThe incidence of CF is approximately 1 in 2500 live births among Caucasians and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The carrier frequency is estimated to be approximately 1 in 25 in the Caucasian population, 1 in 24 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, 1 in 61 in the African American population, 1 in 58 in the Hispanic population and 1 in 94 in the Asian population.\nThe current recommendation from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists [2, 3] and the American College of Medical Genetics Subcommittee on Cystic Fibrosis  is that screening for cystic fibrosis be offered to all patients, regardless of ethnicity, by a minimum panel of 23 common mutations .\nThis test offers an expanded panel of 142 mutations to account for mutations more common in non-Caucasian ethnic groups, as well as rarer mutations across all ethnic groups.\nClick here for a complete list of CFTR mutations.\nFor those providers wishing to order only the ACOG/ACMG recommended 39-mutation panel, see test code CF.\nVisit www.ThinkGenetic.com for patient-friendly information on cystic fibrosis.\n1.

        "passage": "Cystic fibrosis causes thick and sticky mucous throughout the body, leading to serious, chronic and systemic health problems. Along with breathing and lung problems, bowel symptoms are a leading health complication related to cystic fibrosis. This sticky mucous blocks tubes and ducts leading to the pancreas, which prevents essential enzymes from reaching the intestines. These enzymes are essential for the absorption of protein and fats in the body. Therefore, someone with untreated cystic fibrosis has an abundance of fats and proteins in their bowel. This is the cause of gastrointestinal or bowel symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis.\nThe most common bowel symptom related to cystic fibrosis is diarrhea. Stools also commonly appear greasy, bulky and foul-smelling. Stools may also appear pale and clay-colored [source: PubMed Health]. Another common symptom is blockage of the intestines, which leads to excessive gas, constipation and stomach pain. Intestinal blockage is especially common in newborns with cystic fibrosis. A distended, or swollen, abdomen is the result of severe constipation. In newborn infants, not passing their first bowel movement within 24 to 48 hours of birth is characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Children with untreated cystic fibrosis also show poor weight gain and growth. As a result, infants may exhibit a condition called failure to thrive. Poor weight gain and growth is the result of nutritional deficiencies commonly seen in people with cystic fibrosis. Children with cystic fibrosis simply cannot get enough nutrients from the food they eat.\nBowel-related complications are also fairly common in adults with cystic fibrosis. Left untreated, cystic fibrosis can lead to pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is an inflamed pancreas and can be painful. Rectal prolapse, whereby rectal tissue detaches and moves up the gastrointestinal system, is another complication. In severe cases, people with cystic fibrosis can also develop liver disease, diabetes, and gallstones [source: NHLBI].",

In spite of working as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts, and passageways, specifically in the lungs and pancreas. Although cystic fibrosis needs regular care, people with the situation are generally able to join school and work, and sometimes have a better quality of life than people with cystic fibrosis had in earlier decades. Improvements in screening and treatments mean people suffering from cystic fibrosis now may live in their mid- the too late 30s, on average, and some are living in between 40s and 50s.\nSymptoms of Cystic Fibrosis\nScreening of newborns for cystic fibrosis symptoms is now done in each state in the United States. As a result, the situation can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms of cystic fibrosis promote. For people born before newborn screening was done, it is significant to be conscious of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\nCystic fibrosis symptoms differ, based on the depth of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms of cystic fibrosis may worsen or improve as time passes.

CBAVD is a significant cause of male infertility.\nCF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Individuals with mutations in the CFTR gene may also present with milder or atypical symptoms such as pancreatitis or chronic sinusitis.\nThe incidence of CF is approximately 1 in 2500 live births among Caucasians and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The carrier frequency is estimated to be approximately 1 in 25 in the Caucasian population, 1 in 24 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, 1 in 61 in the African American population, 1 in 58 in the Hispanic population and 1 in 94 in the Asian population.\nThe current recommendation from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists [2, 3] and the American College of Medical Genetics Subcommittee on Cystic Fibrosis  is that screening for cystic fibrosis be offered to all patients, regardless of ethnicity, by a minimum panel of 23 common mutations .\nThis test offers an expanded panel of 142 mutations to account for mutations more common in non-Caucasian ethnic groups, as well as rarer mutations across all ethnic groups.\nClick here for a complete list of CFTR mutations.\nFor those providers wishing to order only the ACOG/ACMG recommended 39-mutation panel, see test code CF.\nVisit www.ThinkGenetic.com for patient-friendly information on cystic fibrosis.\n1. Xu et al. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator is vital to sperm fertilizing capacity and male fertility (2007). PNAS. 104(23):9816-21.\n2. ACOG Committee Opinion.\n\nCystic fibrosis causes thick and sticky mucous throughout the body, leading to serious, chronic and systemic health problems. Along with breathing and lung problems, bowel symptoms are a leading health complication related to cystic fibrosis. This sticky mucous blocks tubes and ducts leading to the pancreas, which prevents essential enzymes from reaching the intestines. These enzymes are essential for the absorption of protein and fats in the body. Therefore, someone with untreated cystic fibrosis has an abundance of fats and proteins in their bowel. This is the cause of gastrointestinal or bowel symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis.\nThe most common bowel symptom related to cystic fibrosis is diarrhea. Stools also commonly appear greasy, bulky and foul-smelling. Stools may also appear pale and clay-colored [source: PubMed Health]. Another common symptom is blockage of the intestines, which leads to excessive gas, constipation and stomach pain. Intestinal blockage is especially common in newborns with cystic fibrosis. A distended, or swollen, abdomen is the result of severe constipation. In newborn infants, not passing their first bowel movement within 24 to 48 hours of birth is characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Children with untreated cystic fibrosis also show poor weight gain and growth. As a result, infants may exhibit a condition called failure to thrive. Poor weight gain and growth is the result of nutritional deficiencies commonly seen in people with cystic fibrosis. Children with cystic fibrosis simply cannot get enough nutrients from the food they eat.\nBowel-related complications are also fairly common in adults with cystic fibrosis. Left untreated, cystic fibrosis can lead to pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is an inflamed pancreas and can be painful. Rectal prolapse, whereby rectal tissue detaches and moves up the gastrointestinal system, is another complication. In severe cases, people with cystic fibrosis can also develop liver disease, diabetes, and gallstones [source: NHLBI].\n\nCystic fibrosis is an inherited sickness that creates serious injury to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body. Cystic fibrosis targets the cells that generate mucus, sweat, and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are usually thin and slippery. In people with cystic fibrosis, a dispute gene makes the secretions to become sticky and thick. In spite of working as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts, and passageways, specifically in the lungs and pancreas. Although cystic fibrosis needs regular care, people with the situation are generally able to join school and work, and sometimes have a better quality of life than people with cystic fibrosis had in earlier decades. Improvements in screening and treatments mean people suffering from cystic fibrosis now may live in their mid- the too late 30s, on average, and some are living in between 40s and 50s.\nSymptoms of Cystic Fibrosis\nScreening of newborns for cystic fibrosis symptoms is now done in each state in the United States. As a result, the situation can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms of cystic fibrosis promote. For people born before newborn screening was done, it is significant to be conscious of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\nCystic fibrosis symptoms differ, based on the depth of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms of cystic fibrosis may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not feel symptoms until adulthood.\nPeople with cystic fibrosis have a higher than usual level of salt in their sweat. Parents sometimes can taste salty when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis target the respiratory system and the digestive system. However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, like recurring bouts of pancreatitis, infertility and recurring pneumonia disease.\nCystic Fibrosis Causes\nCauses of cystic fibrosis, a fault in a gene changes a protein that circulates the movement of salt in and out of cells. The outcome is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as developed salt in sweat. Many various disputes can happen in the gene. The type of gene mutation is related to the severity of the situation.\n\nSymptoms Cystic fibrosis\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that affects cells that secrete mucus, sweat, and digestive juices.\nIn normal cases, the fluid being secreted is thin and slippery, but in the case of cystic, a defective gene causes the secretions to become thick and sticky.\nSo, instead of these moisturizing secretions, they block the tubes, ducts and pathways, especially in the lungs and pancreas.\nSymptoms of cystic fibrosis\nCystic fibrosis symptoms and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease, symptoms may improve or worsen over time in the same person.\nIn some children, symptoms begin to appear during infancy and others may not experience symptoms until adolescence or puberty.\nSalt in sweat is usually higher than normal in cystic .\nParents often feel the salt taste when kissing their children.\nMost signs of cystic and other symptoms affect the respiratory system or the digestive system.\nSigns and symptoms of respiratory\nThe thick, viscous mucus associated with cystic fibrosis blocks the ducts that carry air from and to the lungs. This can cause:\nPersistent cough that produces thick sputum (mucus) and mucus.\nWeakness of the ability to exercise sports.\nRecurrent infection of the lungs.\nSinusitis or nasal obstruction.\nSigns and symptoms of gastrointestinal tract\nThick mucus can also block channels that carry digestive enzymes from the pancreas to the small intestine.\nWithout these digestive enzymes, the intestines will not be able to absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. This often results in:\nUnderweight and underweight\nBowel obstruction, especially in newborns (cystic obstruction)\nFrequent stress during stool removal may result in the emergence of part of the rectum, the end of the large intestine, outside the anus (rectal prolapse).\nWhen this happens in children, it may be a sign of cystic, so parents should consult an expert doctor on cystic fibrosis.\nPediatric rectal incontinence may require surgery.\nWhen should I visit a doctor?\nTalk to your doctor if your child has the following:\nPersistent cough that produces mucus\nFrequent infections of the lungs or sinuses\nFrequent smelly greasy stools\nDrop the rectum\nIf your child has trouble breathing, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nCystic Fibrosis is a inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs, digestive system and other organs in the body,\nThe disorder the cells the produce mucus, sweat and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are normally thin and slippery, but people with cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes, the secretions to become sticky and thick. instead of acting like a lubricant the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways in the lungs and pancreas.\nThis disorder requires daily care, most patients can attend school, work and have a better quality of life than they would have decades ago.\nScreening newborns for cystic fibrosis is now performed in every state in the United States.\nPeople with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat, Adult diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms such as recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis) infertility and recurring pneumonia.\nSome symptoms are a persistent cough that produces this mucus, Wheezing, Breathlessness, Exercise intolerance, repeated lung infections, inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose.\nDigestive symptoms are foul-smelling greasy stools, Poor weight gain and growth, intestinal blockage, severe constipation.\nCause is heredity, most likely Northern European Ancestry.\nComplications of this disorder, Damaged airways, chronic infections, growths of polyps in the nose, coughing up blood, pneumothorax, respitory failure, acute exacerbations, Nutritional deficiencies, Diabetes, Blocked bile duct, intestinal obstruction, Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome , Osteopororis, electrolyte imbalance and dehydration.\nThere is a new product invented by Marten Devlieger and the Vest invented allows patients with Cystic Fibrosis to retrieve treatment on the go. @thecfsorceress, www.hill-rom.com Name of Vest is the Monarch.\nMarten\u2019s journey with Cystic fibrosis and how he is helping others live better with their disease.\nMarten lives life to the fullest and wants others to do the same.

    "question": "What is the main difference between Ganoderma lucidum and Ganoderma tsugae fungi in terms of where they grow?",
    "passages": [
      {
        "passage": "Ganoderma lucidum, is an interesting shelf fungus that is important as a medicine in the Far East, in places such as China, Japan and Korea. G. lucidum is of particular interest because it has been portrayed as a \"fix-it-all\" herbal remedy for maladies such as: HIV, cancer, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, diabetes, rheumatism, heart problems, paralysis, ulcers, asthma, tiredness, hepatitis A, B, and C, insomnia, sterility, psoriasis, mumps, epilepsy, alcoholism, and the list goes on. These claims are mostly made by the people who are selling G. lucidum herbal supplements, but G. lucidum, also known as Reishi, ling chih, and ling zhi has a long history of being used as an herbal remedy. We will get to that later.\nFirst, how do you identify Ganoderma lucidum? Ganoderma is a member of the Polypores, a group of fungi characterized by the presence of pores, instead of gills on the underside of the fruiting body. G. lucidum, considered by many mycophiles to be one of the most beautiful shelf fungi, it is distinguished by its varnished, red surface.

The word Ganoderma lucidum was derived from two Latin words, \u2018Gan\u2019 which means shiny and \u2018Derm\u2019 meaning skin and \u2018Lucidum\u2019 with the meaning \u2018brilliant\u2019. This term describes the glossy appearance of the mushroom. The reishi mushroom bears the nickname \u201cqueen of mushrooms\u201d as it has been revered by Chinese people for ages. In China, it is popularly known as \u201cLing Zhi\u201d which means a spiritual or miraculous mushroom, \u201cRui-Zhi\u201d, and \u201cChi-Zhi. In Japan, it is referred to as \u201cReishi\u201d, \u201cSachitake\u201d or \u201cMannatake\u201d. Americans commonly refer to it as Reishi while the Koreans named it \u201cYoungzhi\u201d, while it is wideley referred to as the \u201cmushroom of immortality\u201d. This mushroom belongs to the family Ganodermataceae and the genus Ganoderma.

The forests are usually located in very remote areas that are free from pollution that has clouded a majority of cities today. The reishi mushroom is a polypore, a sizeable group of mushrooms that form on dead and decaying hardwood trees. They have tubes on the underside of their cap with white pores that produce a large number of spores within a short time. A single fungus can give rise to not more than three fruiting bodies. The fruiting body can be flat, shaped like a kidney and grows over 8cm in width. Alternatively, it can be tiny and assume the shape of a cloud. The skin of reishi mushrooms has a reddish-brown glossy appearance. However, the colour ranges from black to purple in certain locations. Mature reishi and growing reishi feel soft, like a sponge.",

G. lucidum is of particular interest because it has been portrayed as a \"fix-it-all\" herbal remedy for maladies such as: HIV, cancer, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, diabetes, rheumatism, heart problems, paralysis, ulcers, asthma, tiredness, hepatitis A, B, and C, insomnia, sterility, psoriasis, mumps, epilepsy, alcoholism, and the list goes on. These claims are mostly made by the people who are selling G. lucidum herbal supplements, but G. lucidum, also known as Reishi, ling chih, and ling zhi has a long history of being used as an herbal remedy. We will get to that later.\nFirst, how do you identify Ganoderma lucidum? Ganoderma is a member of the Polypores, a group of fungi characterized by the presence of pores, instead of gills on the underside of the fruiting body. G. lucidum, considered by many mycophiles to be one of the most beautiful shelf fungi, it is distinguished by its varnished, red surface. When it is young it also has white and yellow shades on the varnished surface, differing from the dull surface of Ganoderma applanatum, the artist's conk. G. lucidum is a saprophytic fungus that tends to grow more prolifically in warm climates on decaying hardwood logs and stumps. This feature helps to distinguish it from a similar looking Ganoderma tsugae, which also has a beautiful red varnished surface, but only grows on the stumps and logs of conifers, especially hemlock (as you might guess from the name).

India has set out a target to be a global super power having the third largest GDP by 2030 and also to have a sustained economic growth of 8-10% for at least another decade. Many countries have decided to adopt the Indian model as a milestone for developing their electricity sector. At any rate, these countries must first appreciate and put in proper perspective, the challenges associated with the India electricity model in order to be able to build a formidable electricity sector. There is therefore the need to install administrative and regulatory measures that would harmonize the varied interests of investors, developers and consumers in India. Also, robust and comprehensive package of policies should be prescribed for the development of hydro potentials and other renewable energy resources at a faster pace to ensure a sincere commitment towards sustainable development. Finally, whilst the Indian model appears closest to a \u2018role model\u2019, Nigeria should only adopt what is \u2018uniquely ours\u2019 from the model and domesticate the same for our own purpose.",

Ltd. (TJPS) speaks to Dipti Srivastava about the challenges of power sector in India and Toshiba's commitment in solving the problems through innovative technologies\nIn the past few years, in spite of various initiatives, power situation still remains one of the core challenges for India. What are the factors responsible for it?\nElectricity is one of the basic constituents for the economic growth of a country and as you said there are various initiatives taken in the country in the past few years to improve the power situation. Toshiba's major expansion of power business in India is also a result of this. One of the biggest concerns is the gap in the demand and supply of power in India. There are several barriers that pose a challenge to the Indian power sector. The first challenge is land acquisition; not only for the power sector but for any industry. The second challenge is speedy environmental clearance.\nThe third challenge is availability of coal. Half of the Indian power generation depends on coal as a source and the production of coal has not increased to match the demand. And the fourth challenge is financial crisis. Because of the recent economic slowdown, financing for new projects have become tougher, especially for Independent Power Producers (IPPs). There was no order from IPPs in the last fiscal year.\nAfter the last general elections in India, there is a huge expectation, both from the general public and the industry that things will improve. At present Power, Coal and New & Renewable Energy ministries are functioning under a single leadership. It means more focused and better co-ordination among these ministries and ultimately improvement in the power situation is expected.\nIn your opinion, how does it impact the economic growth of the nation?\nThe Indian economy is in the trajectory of upward growth. To keep up the momentum of this growth, availability of uninterrupted power supply is a must.",

One of the issues plaguing the power sector in a big way is shortage of equipment. This has been a significant reason for India missing its capacity addition targets. While the shortage has been primarily in the core components of Boilers, Turbines and Generators, there has been lack of adequate supply of Balance of Plant (BOP) equipment as well. There is a shortage of construction equipment also.\nThe current power infrastructure in India is not capable of providing sufficient and reliable power supply. Some 400 million people have zero access to electricity since the grid does not reach their areas.\nAnother problem is unstable power supply. There are frequency fluctuations caused by load generation imbalances in the system and this keeps happening because consumer load keeps changing. Frequency is the most crucial parameter in the operation of AC systems. The rated frequency in India is 50.0 Hz. While the frequency should ideally be close to the rated frequency all the time, it has been a serious problem in India. Poor power quality control has knock-on effects on equipment operation, including large-scale generation capacity. Equipment damage can, of course, further compromise supply and aggravate the effects of chronic fuel shortages.\nTo summarize, Indian power sector has made considerable progress in the last decade and has evolved from a nascent market to a developing market led by policy reforms and increased private sector participation. Challenges do exist in the sector, which India has to overcome to evolve from a developing market to a matured market. Meanwhile, the gap between what can be achieved and what is currently present, uncovers a number of possibilities and opportunities for growth.\nOVER 50 YEARS WITH INDIAN POWER SECTOR\nTHE DEMAND FOR POWER IN INDIA CONTINUES TO INCREASE LEADING TO THE NEED FOR HIGH-END POWER TURBINE & GENERATORS, WHICH IS ONE OF TOSHIBA'S CORE EXPERTISE\nToshiba has been an integral part of India's power sector for decades.",

Recent blackouts may have shined a spotlight on this gap, but it\u2019s a situation that\u2019s widespread in India: Not only do 400 million Indians lack access to electricity, but electricity supply is unreliable and of poor quality even in large parts of \u201celectrified\u201d India. In addition to the existing demand, Indian consumers, businesses, and industries seek more electricity to power appliances, processes, and products, further exacerbating the demand-supply gap.

India has set out a target to be a global super power having the third largest GDP by 2030 and also to have a sustained economic growth of 8-10% for at least another decade. Many countries have decided to adopt the Indian model as a milestone for developing their electricity sector. At any rate, these countries must first appreciate and put in proper perspective, the challenges associated with the India electricity model in order to be able to build a formidable electricity sector. There is therefore the need to install administrative and regulatory measures that would harmonize the varied interests of investors, developers and consumers in India. Also, robust and comprehensive package of policies should be prescribed for the development of hydro potentials and other renewable energy resources at a faster pace to ensure a sincere commitment towards sustainable development. Finally, whilst the Indian model appears closest to a \u2018role model\u2019, Nigeria should only adopt what is \u2018uniquely ours\u2019 from the model and domesticate the same for our own purpose.\n\nA number of policy measures at national level, which could be applied concurrently, would significantly improve the framework for renewable energy in India.\nAfter all, India's rapid and enduring economic growth is intrinsically linked to the increasing consumption of energy and natural resources.\nINTERVIEW YOSHIAKI INAYAMA\nOUR MAIN FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE TURNKEY EMPCS SOLUTIONS TO THE INDIAN POWER SECTOR\nWe create 100% INDIGENOUS Power Solutions\nYoshiaki Inayama , Managing Director, Toshiba JSW Power Systems Pvt. Ltd. (TJPS) speaks to Dipti Srivastava about the challenges of power sector in India and Toshiba's commitment in solving the problems through innovative technologies\nIn the past few years, in spite of various initiatives, power situation still remains one of the core challenges for India. What are the factors responsible for it?\nElectricity is one of the basic constituents for the economic growth of a country and as you said there are various initiatives taken in the country in the past few years to improve the power situation. Toshiba's major expansion of power business in India is also a result of this. One of the biggest concerns is the gap in the demand and supply of power in India. There are several barriers that pose a challenge to the Indian power sector. The first challenge is land acquisition; not only for the power sector but for any industry. The second challenge is speedy environmental clearance.\nThe third challenge is availability of coal. Half of the Indian power generation depends on coal as a source and the production of coal has not increased to match the demand. And the fourth challenge is financial crisis. Because of the recent economic slowdown, financing for new projects have become tougher, especially for Independent Power Producers (IPPs). There was no order from IPPs in the last fiscal year.\nAfter the last general elections in India, there is a huge expectation, both from the general public and the industry that things will improve. At present Power, Coal and New & Renewable Energy ministries are functioning under a single leadership. It means more focused and better co-ordination among these ministries and ultimately improvement in the power situation is expected.\nIn your opinion, how does it impact the economic growth of the nation?\nThe Indian economy is in the trajectory of upward growth. To keep up the momentum of this growth, availability of uninterrupted power supply is a must.\n\nThe importance of electricity as a prime driver of growth is very well acknowledged and in order to boost the development of power system, the Indian government has participated in a big way through creation of various corporations such as, State Electricity Boards (SEB), NTPC Limited, NHPC Limited and Power Grid Corporation Limited (PGCL), etc. However, even after this the country is facing power shortage.\nThere are many problems faced by the power sector and these need to be addressed. One of the issues plaguing the power sector in a big way is shortage of equipment. This has been a significant reason for India missing its capacity addition targets. While the shortage has been primarily in the core components of Boilers, Turbines and Generators, there has been lack of adequate supply of Balance of Plant (BOP) equipment as well. There is a shortage of construction equipment also.\nThe current power infrastructure in India is not capable of providing sufficient and reliable power supply. Some 400 million people have zero access to electricity since the grid does not reach their areas.\nAnother problem is unstable power supply. There are frequency fluctuations caused by load generation imbalances in the system and this keeps happening because consumer load keeps changing. Frequency is the most crucial parameter in the operation of AC systems. The rated frequency in India is 50.0 Hz. While the frequency should ideally be close to the rated frequency all the time, it has been a serious problem in India. Poor power quality control has knock-on effects on equipment operation, including large-scale generation capacity. Equipment damage can, of course, further compromise supply and aggravate the effects of chronic fuel shortages.\nTo summarize, Indian power sector has made considerable progress in the last decade and has evolved from a nascent market to a developing market led by policy reforms and increased private sector participation. Challenges do exist in the sector, which India has to overcome to evolve from a developing market to a matured market. Meanwhile, the gap between what can be achieved and what is currently present, uncovers a number of possibilities and opportunities for growth.\nOVER 50 YEARS WITH INDIAN POWER SECTOR\nTHE DEMAND FOR POWER IN INDIA CONTINUES TO INCREASE LEADING TO THE NEED FOR HIGH-END POWER TURBINE & GENERATORS, WHICH IS ONE OF TOSHIBA'S CORE EXPERTISE\nToshiba has been an integral part of India's power sector for decades.\n\nWith its introduction, the power sector is expecting to install Smart Metres everywhere and online mode of electricity bill payment has also been possible.\nThe power distribution companies account for at least 1.25 crore losses while transmitting and distributing electricity which is 20% of the total energy generated. This problem of huge losses can be brought down by up to 5% loss with the installation of smart metres in every space.\nWith the smart digital transformation, the Indian Economy is supposed to save at least Rupees 10 Crore in 10 years. Which is quite a large amount, and this surplus money can rather be invested to create renewable sources of energy. According to the visions of the BJP government, India should depend on Renewable sources of energy against the current statistics which is just 15%. The money saved from the installation of smart metres can thus be used to create more Renewable sources of energy.\nThis, the new digital drive is going to empower both economically and environmentally. The new digital drive has also brought in Convenience, both for the Energy producing companies and their consumers. Electricity bill payments can now be paid just with a single touch on our phone screen. And, the consumers also got access to a lot of information through this.\nImpacts on the manufacturers of electrical products \u2013 The private sector is expected to witness considerable growth with the recent investment in the NIP as the power sector challenges to create a robust infrastructure and digitalize millions of homes in India. With a new demand in the market, many companies like Vensor, Havells, Finolex, Rallison are putting on more effort into creating better services even though they are already known for their best and most efficient quality.\nChallenges \u2013 The present scenario, however, isn\u2019t very happening. Only a few percentages of residents have shifted to digital smart metres. People often fear risks and threats in the world of the internet and does not want to switch to the same. However, the government is trying to focus on the challenges and succeed accordingly. The high costs, the contrasting attitude of common citizens and government personnel, poor educational quality are also going to be major challenges to be faced by the government while the digitalization of India.\nConclusion- In short, we can conclude that the digital drive has more good impacts than bad. Latest innovations have successfully been reducing the threats and are trying to empower India with digital power and help improve the power sector and its infrastructure.\n\nIndia recently experienced one of the world\u2019s worst blackouts, with 670 million citizens directly impacted. While media reports have focused on the repercussions from two days of outages, this incident illustrates a much larger, more systemic problem: the need for improved electricity governance.\nIndia\u2019s History of Power Problems\nIndia has the world\u2019s fifth-largest electrical system, with an installed electric capacity of about 206 gigawatts (GW). India initiated power sector reforms in the early 1990s through a range of legal, policy, and regulatory changes. Over the last two decades, some of these reforms have been impressive, but several others weren\u2019t taken. This lack of follow-through has resulted in a growing gap between electricity demand and supply throughout the country. Recent blackouts may have shined a spotlight on this gap, but it\u2019s a situation that\u2019s widespread in India: Not only do 400 million Indians lack access to electricity, but electricity supply is unreliable and of poor quality even in large parts of \u201celectrified\u201d India.

    "answer": "India faces significant challenges in its power sector regarding electricity access and supply. A substantial portion of the population, estimated at 400 million Indians, lacks access to electricity. Additionally, even in areas considered 'electrified,' the supply is unreliable and of poor quality. The growing demand for electricity, exacerbated by the desire for more appliances, processes, and products, further stretches the system. By 2035, India's power demand is expected to more than double, highlighting the urgent need to address these issues to meet future energy demands effectively.",

These chillies are readily available in Latin markets and are a good choice for your chili making requirements. The best way to use these peppers is to soak them in boiling water, remove from the heat and let them soak for a hour or so. Remove the stems and seeds and process the skins in a blender or food processor, then run the pulp through a strainer. You will get some beautiful pulp free red sauce that you may adapt for different dishes. 6,000 scoville units.\nTien Tsin Peppers:\nThese peppers are also traditionally used in Asian cooing and are very hot. You can add whole to soup or any stir fry dish where you want a spicy flavor. They may also be used to make Asian chili oil. Just heat 2 tbs of peanut oil. When very hot add about 10 peppers, fry until brown. (3 to 5 minutes) Remove from heat and add 1/2 cup of peanut oil. Let cool, then place in an air tight jar. If you like really spicy oil leave the peppers in the oil. This oil is great drizzled or mixed with soy sauce to make a hot dipping sauce. Use 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1 tbs of chili oil, 1 clove garlic minced and 1 tsp ginger. Mix well and dip. 60,000 scoville units.\nIn Mexico alone there are over 100 varieties. The hottest peppers are the Habanero or Scotch bonnet, handle these with care and last but not least is the Indian Ghost pepper. If I were you I wouldn\u2019t even mess with this as its at least 20 times hotter than the habanero. Why do you think they call it Ghost?",

    "answer": "In Indian cuisine, chili peppers are often combined with other spices to create full-bodied flavors, whereas in Mexican cooking, specific types of chilies such as ancho, chipotle, and pasilla are commonly used for dishes like red chili sauces and mole. Additionally, Indian dishes may use Aleppo peppers for a tart and mild heat, while Mexican dishes favor guajillo peppers for their rich, deep flavor and spiciness.",

        "passage": "Located on the wall of the dining room of the former Dominican convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, exactly in the refectory of the convent, the Last Supper, a late 15th-century mural painting by the great Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, is one of the most famous and fascinating, most studied and reproduced and the subject of many legends and controversies. Commissioned by Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan and painted by the master artist between 1495 and 1498, the coloured plaster of the enormous fresco measuring 15 by 29 feet (4.6 x 8.8 meters), covers the entire wall of the refectory, although the room was not a refectory at the time that Leonardo painted it.\nInstead of using tempera on wet plaster, the usual method of fresco painting, Leonardo painted it on dry plaster, as he sought a greater detail and luminosity than could be achieved with traditional fresco and it resulted in a more varied palette. In fact, traces of gold and silver foils have been found which testify to the artist's eagerness to make the figures much more realistic. He chose to seal the stone wall with a double layer of dried plaster, composed of gesso (gypsum prepared with glue), pitch, and mastic. After that, he added an undercoat of white lead to enhance the brightness of the oil and tempera that was applied on top. Unfortunately, his experiment did not work, as the painted plaster began to flake off the wall almost immediately. Various authorities have struggled to restore it ever since.\nThe layout of the fresco is largely horizontal. All the figures are set behind the large table, which is seen in the foreground of the image. The painting is also largely symmetrical with the same number of figures on either side of Jesus.\nThe Last Supper is the visual interpretation of the artist of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels, depicting the evening before Christ was to be betrayed by one of his disciples. He gathered them all together to eat and to tell them that he knew what was going to happen soon. The fresco depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one of his disciples would betray him before the sunrise and the different reactions of horror, shock and anger of the twelve apostles.",

        "passage": "By Mike Shoopman\nThe painting that I chose is entitled The Last Supper by Tintoretto. This magnificent painting shows a great amount of detail and it seems to draw in the viewer more than Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s depiction of this important event in history. In Tintoretto\u2019s The Last Supper, Jesus is shown with a glow about him that instantly grabs the viewer\u2019s attention and leaves no question about which person is Jesus. Each of Jesus\u2019 disciples, except for Judas whom is kneeling on the opposite side of the table from the others, also has a small glow around their head that sets them apart from the other people in the painting. In addition to Jesus and his disciples, there are several other people in the room preparing the meal for Jesus and his disciples. Not only has Tintoretto portrayed the physical realm, he has also included a spiritual realm. Several angels are shown flying in the room, which along with Jesus\u2019 illumination depicts his divine nature.\nThis amazing work of art was painted from 1592 to 1594 (Matthews, Platt, and Noble 396). Tintoretto was in his middle 70\u2019s when he painted it, and he died within the same year that he finished this great painting (Matthews, Platt, and Noble 396). Tintoretto\u2019s the Last Supper is in good condition and is located in Sam Giorgio Maggiore Church in Venice, Italy (Matthews, Platt, and Noble 396).\nI viewed this painting in The Western Humanities: Fifth Edition on page 396.

Commissioned by Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan and painted by the master artist between 1495 and 1498, the coloured plaster of the enormous fresco measuring 15 by 29 feet (4.6 x 8.8 meters), covers the entire wall of the refectory, although the room was not a refectory at the time that Leonardo painted it.\nInstead of using tempera on wet plaster, the usual method of fresco painting, Leonardo painted it on dry plaster, as he sought a greater detail and luminosity than could be achieved with traditional fresco and it resulted in a more varied palette. In fact, traces of gold and silver foils have been found which testify to the artist's eagerness to make the figures much more realistic. He chose to seal the stone wall with a double layer of dried plaster, composed of gesso (gypsum prepared with glue), pitch, and mastic. After that, he added an undercoat of white lead to enhance the brightness of the oil and tempera that was applied on top. Unfortunately, his experiment did not work, as the painted plaster began to flake off the wall almost immediately. Various authorities have struggled to restore it ever since.\nThe layout of the fresco is largely horizontal. All the figures are set behind the large table, which is seen in the foreground of the image. The painting is also largely symmetrical with the same number of figures on either side of Jesus.\nThe Last Supper is the visual interpretation of the artist of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels, depicting the evening before Christ was to be betrayed by one of his disciples. He gathered them all together to eat and to tell them that he knew what was going to happen soon. The fresco depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one of his disciples would betray him before the sunrise and the different reactions of horror, shock and anger of the twelve apostles.\n\nLast Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)\nThe Last Supper (in Italian:Il Cenacolo or L\u2019Ultima Cena) is a late 15th century mural painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie.\nCommissioned to Leonardo Da Vinci by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, The Last Supper was part of an overall renovation of the church and its convent buildings, and was commenced around 1495.\nIn the painting, which represents the scene of The Last Supper of Jesus with his disciples, as told in the Gospel of John, 13:21, Leonardo depicted the consternation that occurred among the Twelve Disciples when Jesus announced that one of them would betray him.\nSanta Maria of the Grazie\nSanta Maria della Grazie (\u201cHoly Mary of Grace\u201c) is a church and Dominican convent in Milan, northern Italy, included in the Unesco World Heritage sites list.\nThe church contains the mural of The Last Supper, which is in the refectory of the convent.\n\nSkip the Line: Entrance Ticket to Leonardo Da Vincis The Last Supper in Milan\nBeach Enjoy Calm 42cm nbsp;pinkTote Keep Maternity 10 Natural HippoWarehouse Leave litres x38cm Shopping Bag and Gym Duration: 40 minutes\nFill your day with art, and see Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cThe Last Supper\u201d in Milan with a skip-the-line ticket.

This magnificent painting shows a great amount of detail and it seems to draw in the viewer more than Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s depiction of this important event in history. In Tintoretto\u2019s The Last Supper, Jesus is shown with a glow about him that instantly grabs the viewer\u2019s attention and leaves no question about which person is Jesus. Each of Jesus\u2019 disciples, except for Judas whom is kneeling on the opposite side of the table from the others, also has a small glow around their head that sets them apart from the other people in the painting. In addition to Jesus and his disciples, there are several other people in the room preparing the meal for Jesus and his disciples. Not only has Tintoretto portrayed the physical realm, he has also included a spiritual realm. Several angels are shown flying in the room, which along with Jesus\u2019 illumination depicts his divine nature.\nThis amazing work of art was painted from 1592 to 1594 (Matthews, Platt, and Noble 396). Tintoretto was in his middle 70\u2019s when he painted it, and he died within the same year that he finished this great painting (Matthews, Platt, and Noble 396). Tintoretto\u2019s the Last Supper is in good condition and is located in Sam Giorgio Maggiore Church in Venice, Italy (Matthews, Platt, and Noble 396).\nI viewed this painting in The Western Humanities: Fifth Edition on page 396.

        "passage": "One of the key advantages of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) is their immunity to crosstalk, because of their inherently slow (100-\u03bcs\u20131-ms) gain dynamics.1 This lack of crosstalk makes EDFAs suitable for use in multichannel fiber networks. In such applications, however, occasional bursts of traffic may result in gain fluctuations because of transient saturation in the EDFA, causing packet-to-packet data interferences. Automatic gain control (AGC) loops can be used to achieve such necessary gain stabilization. A feed-forward AGC loop was shown;1 it acts on the pump source to increase the gain as a transient of higher signal power as detected at the EDFA input. The main disadvantage of AGC through pump power control is the large pump power change, \u0394Pp, necessary to compensate for the gain fluctuation, \u0394G (e.g., \u0394Pp \u2248 15 mW for \u0394G ~ 3 dB).2 In this paper we demonstrate an alternate scheme for AGC feedback loops requiring a comparatively very lowcontrol power of 2 \u03bcW.

    "answer": "Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs) are special because they amplify optical signals directly without the need for converting them to an electrical signal first. They use the core of a silica optical fiber doped with erbium ions as the gain medium. The amplification window of EDFAs is in the 1.5-micron wavelength range, which is ideal for long-haul telecommunications due to low attenuation in standard optical fibers at this wavelength. This allows EDFAs to be used effectively in compensating for signal loss over long distances in optical fiber communication systems.",

Paul Grosklags, principle military deputy to the assistant secretary of the Navy for research development and acquisition, who spoke to USNI News on Thursday.\nThe new concept is completely different from what the original progenitors of the program \u2014 including current deputy defense secretary Bob Work \u2014 had intended, but seems to fit inline with the Navy\u2019s current thinking about maritime threats in the Western Pacific.\nThe missions now in mind for UCLASS now include permissive airspace ISR and strike initially to start with, Grosklags said. As the program evolves, those missions would expand to more challenging contested littoral and coastal ISR and strike, to attacking an enemy surface action groups (SAG).\nThe requirements for the UCLASS have been set and that the Pentagon had expected to hold a Defense Acquisitions Board (DAB) meeting next Monday, Grosklags testified before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces on Wednesday.\nHowever, Work has requested a \u201cprecursor\u201d meeting ahead of the DAB, which forced the Pentagon to postpone.\nBoth the meeting with Work and the DAB are now expected next week before the final request for proposals (RFP) is released to the four companies competing: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Atomics and Northrop Grumman.

    "final_prompt": "\nBelow you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. \nPlease review the following texts carefully. \nWhile the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.\n\n---Begin Context---\nThe Navy seems to have shifted its concept for the Unmanned Carrier Launched Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) for a third time in as many years part of the most confusing and misunderstood aviation acquisition programs in the last decade.\nAt its 2006 conception, the new generation of carrier based unmanned aerial vehicles would be built to extend the inland reach of carrier strike groups a well beyond the reach of the current crop of manned fighters.\nIn 2011, the Navy and the Pentagon moved to make a lower cost UAV to be quickly pushed into service to hunt terrorists, anticipating a world where U.S. forces could be restricted in flying land-based UAVs as well as act as an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) asset when the rest of the carrier air wing was off-duty.\nNow, the Navy seems to have again changed the character of the planned UCLASS into an aircraft that will almost exclusively spend its time over the ocean.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much part of our maritime package, as part of the carrier strike group,\u201d said Vice Adm. Paul Grosklags, principle military deputy to the assistant secretary of the Navy for research development and acquisition, who spoke to USNI News on Thursday.\nThe new concept is completely different from what the original progenitors of the program \u2014 including current deputy defense secretary Bob Work \u2014 had intended, but seems to fit inline with the Navy\u2019s current thinking about maritime threats in the Western Pacific.\nThe missions now in mind for UCLASS now include permissive airspace ISR and strike initially to start with, Grosklags said. As the program evolves, those missions would expand to more challenging contested littoral and coastal ISR and strike, to attacking an enemy surface action groups (SAG).\nThe requirements for the UCLASS have been set and that the Pentagon had expected to hold a Defense Acquisitions Board (DAB) meeting next Monday, Grosklags testified before the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces on Wednesday.\nHowever, Work has requested a \u201cprecursor\u201d meeting ahead of the DAB, which forced the Pentagon to postpone.\nBoth the meeting with Work and the DAB are now expected next week before the final request for proposals (RFP) is released to the four companies competing: Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Atomics and Northrop Grumman. The RFP is restricted even though the most of the document is unclassified.\n\nNavy officer with Door County roots is leading unmanned surveillance aircraft mission\nELLISON BAY - A U.S. Navy officer with Door County roots has become the next commander of the Navy's new program to deploy unmanned surveillance aircraft.\nCommander John LeVoy, the son of Lee and Hugh LeVoy, of Ellison Bay, became the commanding officer of Unmanned Patrol Squadron 19 in a change of command ceremony June 5 aboard Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida.\nUnmanned Patrol Squadron 19 includes 300 sailors and 200 civilian contractors with the mission to fly two types of unmanned aerial vehicles, the MQ-4C Triton and RQ-4A Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator, according to a U.S. Navy news release.\n\"The change of command ceremony was wonderful,\" said Lee LeVoy. The couple was grateful to attend the event, she said.\nJohn LeVoy will lead the \"historic, first-ever flight of the MQ-4C Triton,\" the release said.\n\nThe U.S. Navy plans to deploy unmanned aerial systems (UAS) on board submarines, to provide covert intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and target acquisition to support special operations and full-scale warfare, on sub-surface and surface operations. According to the Navy\u2019s plans, attack and guided missile submarine will be equipped with a miniature UAS known as \u2018Blackwing,\u2019 produced by Aerovironment Inc. The Navy plans to buy 150 such systems. The company introduced the new unmanned vehicle at the Sea Air Space event in Washington DC.\nTypical operation will see the Blacking deployed in the vicinity of targets in contested or denied airspace, where activities of other manned or unmanned platforms would be too risky. From its forward position, the Blackwing will provide target acquisition and battle damage assessment, in support of strikes performed from stand-off range.\nDuring the demonstration phase (2013-2015) the AWESUM \u201cdemonstrates submarine launch, data sharing and control across naval, special operations and air-force units. Photo via Aerovironment Inc.\nAs part of the Fiscal Year 2017 budget submission to Congress, the Navy is asking for small Blackwing UAVs to be launched from attack and guided missile submarines, the Navy\u2019s director for undersea warfare Rear Adm. Charles Richard told USNI News.\nSOURCES \u2013 Defense Update, USNI\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles aren\u2019t brand-spanking new to naval aviation; UAVs the Navy uses include the rotary-wing Fire Scout and the RQ-2A Pioneer. But the next big thing in unmanned flight at sea will be an aircraft that can take off from and land on a carrier. Several companies are in the process of making that happen.\nThe big names in flight are displaying wares that they hope become the backbone of the Navy\u2019s collection of UAVs at the Sea Air Space Expo at the Gaylord National Resort Hotel and Convention Center in National Harbor, Md.\nLook at the pictures above. At left is Northrop Grumman\u2019s X-47B, a UAV that made its first flight in February. The one on the right is Boeing\u2019s X-45C.

    "answer": "Aerial surveillance in the Navy has changed significantly with the introduction of unmanned vehicles, moving towards increased autonomy and integration with existing fleets. These systems, such as the X-47B by Northrop Grumman and Boeing's X-45C, are designed to operate from carriers, enhancing capabilities without the risks associated with manned flights. Additionally, advancements in technology like the Tactical Autonomous Aerial Logistics System (TALOS) and the Office of Naval Research's developments in autonomous UUVs indicate a trend toward more intelligent and networked unmanned systems that can work in tandem with human operators, improving operational efficiency and versatility.",

Its desolate environment is inhospitable to life: liquid water is nearly, if not wholly, nonexistent, and the oxygen-rich atmosphere that gives the planet its familiar reddish tinge is hostile to the early biosynthesis required for life \u2014 historically thought to be only possible in oxygen-poor atmospheres.\nOver the years, though, NASA rovers have found geological evidence that points toward the past presence of flowing liquid water and minerals that form only in oxygen-poor environments, suggesting that the planet once had conditions to support early life.\nThe researchers modeled Mars\u2019 climate and atmospheric chemistry, actually finding \u201cfluctuations\u201d between these oxygen-poor \u2014 or reducing \u2014 and oxygen-rich \u2014 or oxidizing \u2014 conditions over time, according to Robin D. Wordsworth, lead author and Harvard professor of Environmental Science and Engineering.\nThe fluctuating presence or absence of oxygen on Mars would have affected its climate over time, according to Wordsworth. Because oxygen is a poor greenhouse gas, the Martian atmosphere would have trapped less heat during its oxygen-rich periods. Oxygen-poor periods, however, were characterized by a greater abundance of hydrogen gas, which \u2014 in combination with carbon dioxide \u2014 would have acted as a \u201cpotent\u201d greenhouse gas and more efficiently retained heat.\n\u201cThere is a current popular hypothesis for warming early Mars in a reducing environment with a lot of hydrogen.

This hint of more oxygen in Mars\u2019 early atmosphere adds to other Curiosity findings \u2014 such as evidence about ancient lakes \u2014 revealing how Earth-like our neighboring planet once was,\u201d NASA reported.\nThe newly announced results stem from results obtained from the rovers mast mounted ChemCam or Chemistry and Camera laser firing instrument.

Its desolate environment is inhospitable to life: liquid water is nearly, if not wholly, nonexistent, and the oxygen-rich atmosphere that gives the planet its familiar reddish tinge is hostile to the early biosynthesis required for life \u2014 historically thought to be only possible in oxygen-poor atmospheres.\nOver the years, though, NASA rovers have found geological evidence that points toward the past presence of flowing liquid water and minerals that form only in oxygen-poor environments, suggesting that the planet once had conditions to support early life.\nThe researchers modeled Mars\u2019 climate and atmospheric chemistry, actually finding \u201cfluctuations\u201d between these oxygen-poor \u2014 or reducing \u2014 and oxygen-rich \u2014 or oxidizing \u2014 conditions over time, according to Robin D. Wordsworth, lead author and Harvard professor of Environmental Science and Engineering.\nThe fluctuating presence or absence of oxygen on Mars would have affected its climate over time, according to Wordsworth. Because oxygen is a poor greenhouse gas, the Martian atmosphere would have trapped less heat during its oxygen-rich periods. Oxygen-poor periods, however, were characterized by a greater abundance of hydrogen gas, which \u2014 in combination with carbon dioxide \u2014 would have acted as a \u201cpotent\u201d greenhouse gas and more efficiently retained heat.\n\u201cThere is a current popular hypothesis for warming early Mars in a reducing environment with a lot of hydrogen. This paper suggests that the early Martian climate didn\u2019t need to be primarily oxidizing or reducing; that oscillating between these environments is possible,\u201d Kathryn E. Steakley, NASA postdoctoral program fellow and contributor to the paper, wrote in an emailed statement.\n\nNew chemical science findings from NASA\u2019s Mars rover Curiosity indicate that ancient Mars likely had a higher abundance of molecular oxygen in its atmosphere compared to the present day and was thus more hospitable to life forms, if they ever existed.\nThus the Red Planet was much more Earth-like and potentially habitable billions of years ago compared to the cold, barren place we see today.\nManganese-oxide minerals require abundant water and strongly oxidizing conditions to form.\n\u201cResearchers found high levels of manganese oxides by using a laser-firing instrument on the rover. This hint of more oxygen in Mars\u2019 early atmosphere adds to other Curiosity findings \u2014 such as evidence about ancient lakes \u2014 revealing how Earth-like our neighboring planet once was,\u201d NASA reported.\nThe newly announced results stem from results obtained from the rovers mast mounted ChemCam or Chemistry and Camera laser firing instrument. ChemCam operates by firing laser pulses and then observes the spectrum of resulting flashes of plasma to assess targets\u2019 chemical makeup.\n\u201cThe only ways on Earth that we know how to make these manganese materials involve atmospheric oxygen or microbes,\u201d said Nina Lanza, a planetary scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, in a statement.\n\u201cNow we\u2019re seeing manganese oxides on Mars, and we\u2019re wondering how the heck these could have formed?\u201d\nThe discovery is being published in a new paper in the American Geophysical Union\u2019s Geophysical Research Letters. Lanza is the lead author.\nThe manganese oxides were found by ChemCam in mineral veins investigated at \u201cWindjana\u201d and are part of geologic timeline being assembled from Curiosity\u2019s research expedition across of the floor of the Gale Crater landing site.\nScientists have been able to link the new finding of a higher oxygen level to a time when groundwater was present inside Gale Crater.\n\u201cThese high manganese materials can\u2019t form without lots of liquid water and strongly oxidizing conditions,\u201d says Lanza.\n\u201cHere on Earth, we had lots of water but no widespread deposits of manganese oxides until after the oxygen levels in our atmosphere rose.\u201d\nThe high-manganese materials were found in mineral-filled cracks in sandstones in the \u201cKimberley\u201d region of the crater.\nHigh concentrations of manganese oxide minerals in Earth\u2019s ancient past correspond to a major shift in our atmosphere\u2019s composition from low to high oxygen atmospheric concentrations. Thus its reasonable to suggest the same thing happened on ancient Mars.\nAs part of the investigation, Curiosity also conducted a drill campaign at Windjana, her 3rd of the mission.\n---End Context---\n\n--Question--\nWhat evidence suggests that Mars once had more oxygen in its atmosphere than it does today?\n\nInstructions:\n- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.\n- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.\n\n--Response Rules--\n- Response should be a json with key 'answer'",

However, athletes who regularly engage in high-intensity workouts or who are trying to build muscle mass may benefit from consuming 200 grams of protein on a daily basis.\nMaximum Safe Amounts\nAccording to the \"International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism,\" a maximum safe protein intake is 2.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or about 1.1 gram of protein per pound of body weight each day.

Burnout is a complex clinical condition with no single cause. Symptoms and signs vary from person to person, but tend to occur mainly in dancers whose daily schedules produce an imbalance between physical activity and time for recovery. Burnout can occur as a result of a few days or weeks of fatigue, by long-term exhaustion and by psychological stress.\nBurnout can affect both male and female dancers of all ages and levels of competence. Those most likely to reach the stage of burnout are usually the ones who set very high standards for themselves. Relative levels of physical fitness also relate to burnout\u2014i.e. for the same workload, fit dancers are less likely to suffer than their unfit counterparts.\nWho is most vulnerable to burnout?\nWe know that adolescents are particularly vulnerable to injuries. Apart from periodic growth spurts that decrease muscle strength and flexibility, a teenager's musculoskeletal system is less resistant to repetitive loads during development. According to the 2003 Proceedings from the Annual Meeting of the International Association for Dance Medicine & Science (IADMS), students who work more than 8.5 hours a week at age 14 increase the risk of overuse injuries. The same is true for 15-year-old dancers who work more than 10 hours a week.\nWhen do I need to be careful?\nUnfortunately, the drive to exceed personal limits is ingrained in dancers of all ages, regardless of the toll. Tony Geeves\u2019s research for the Safe Dance Project Report (Ausdance, 1990) found that 52% of dancers in Australia had chronic injury by age 18.\nIn a study conducted by the Harkness Center for Dance Injuries (UK), 79% of 500 injuries happened at the end of the day, occurring after five or more hours of work. 1 Safe Dance ll research reported that 28% of surveyed dancer\u2019s incurred injuries within three weeks of returning to training after a holiday. 2\nFatigue is the number one indicator of burnout. Dancers could learn from athletes who use periodisation (hard workouts are alternated with easier routines that have rest built into them) to prevent overload. Burned-out dancers need to let themselves do less without labelling themselves as \u2018lazy\u2019.",

    "final_prompt": "\nBelow you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. \nPlease review the following texts carefully. \nWhile the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.\n\n---Begin Context---\nConstant training, without enough rest, puts stress on a body\u2019s ability to adapt which can lead to fatigue, muscular weakness and frequent injuries\u2014burnout. Burnout is a complex clinical condition with no single cause. Symptoms and signs vary from person to person, but tend to occur mainly in dancers whose daily schedules produce an imbalance between physical activity and time for recovery. Burnout can occur as a result of a few days or weeks of fatigue, by long-term exhaustion and by psychological stress.\nBurnout can affect both male and female dancers of all ages and levels of competence. Those most likely to reach the stage of burnout are usually the ones who set very high standards for themselves. Relative levels of physical fitness also relate to burnout\u2014i.e. for the same workload, fit dancers are less likely to suffer than their unfit counterparts.\nWho is most vulnerable to burnout?\nWe know that adolescents are particularly vulnerable to injuries. Apart from periodic growth spurts that decrease muscle strength and flexibility, a teenager's musculoskeletal system is less resistant to repetitive loads during development. According to the 2003 Proceedings from the Annual Meeting of the International Association for Dance Medicine & Science (IADMS), students who work more than 8.5 hours a week at age 14 increase the risk of overuse injuries. The same is true for 15-year-old dancers who work more than 10 hours a week.\nWhen do I need to be careful?\nUnfortunately, the drive to exceed personal limits is ingrained in dancers of all ages, regardless of the toll. Tony Geeves\u2019s research for the Safe Dance Project Report (Ausdance, 1990) found that 52% of dancers in Australia had chronic injury by age 18.\nIn a study conducted by the Harkness Center for Dance Injuries (UK), 79% of 500 injuries happened at the end of the day, occurring after five or more hours of work. 1 Safe Dance ll research reported that 28% of surveyed dancer\u2019s incurred injuries within three weeks of returning to training after a holiday. 2\nFatigue is the number one indicator of burnout. Dancers could learn from athletes who use periodisation (hard workouts are alternated with easier routines that have rest built into them) to prevent overload. Burned-out dancers need to let themselves do less without labelling themselves as \u2018lazy\u2019.\n\nThe judging is fierce and the competition makes the dancer want to strive even harder to become an amazing artist. Dance is strenuous. In fact, dancers have one of the highest rates of non-fatal on the-job injury. \u201d The causes of most dance injuries are pushing for perfection so hard that muscles are strained, shin splints occur, plantar fasciitis happens, and stress fractures are created. When dancers have this the best way to cure it is stretching before and after dancing. If any serious injury occurs like breaking bones landing a move wrong it could ruin the dancer\u2019s career.\nMost dancers retire around the age of 30 if an injury happens early the dancers career they will usually retire a teacher. Recovering could take a few weeks to years. A lot of dancers have permanent damage to their body after a vigorous career of muscles being strained and the body being pushed to its limit. Becoming a professional dancer is risky but rewarding. To become a professional dancer it takes hours of practice in a studio and the acceptance of not becoming a huge star with a lot of money.\nTo embark on the journey to become a professional dancer the first decision to make is what style of dance, after the decision is made the next step is to find a dance studio, during the training in the studio cross training will be needed to become stronger and more flexible, the finance, competitions and injuries are all ideas to consider before committing to a vigorous but rewarding schedule. Every dancer has a different opinion of this profession but the ones who love to dance and have the passion that no one could ever take away from them are the ones who are happy and loving every second of it.\n\nHow You Can Prevent Ballet Injuries\nBallet injuries can be prevented by making sure that you are wearing properly fitted shoes, especially if you are dancing en pointe.\nThere are professionals you can see who know how to fit you properly for pointe shoes; ask your ballet instructor how to find one. Once you have your shoes, take proper care of them.\nDancers should not try dancing en pointe before the age of 11 or 12. By doing so, they can risk growth-plate injuries, and the bones of their feet may develop improperly.\nIndeed, no dancer should ever attempt a feat that he or she is not ready for. As in sports, proper training in dancing is crucial to injury prevention.\n- Ensure proper nutrition.\n- If you increase your training schedule, take it slowly; don\u2019t suddenly go from once a week to every day.\n- If you spend most of one workout en pointe or demi-pointe, focus your next workout on something else.\n- Avoid dancing on hard surfaces.\n- Avoid dancing on uneven surfaces.\n- If you are in pain, STOP!\n\n\u201cThis is a set of skills that can be taught and transferred easily to safely support movement.\u201d\nYet, on the flipside, others argue that some of the injuries can be attributed to the fact that the contestants are often out-of-shape, non-dancers. Some say the celeb injuries are pretty much inevitable.\n\u201cDancing at the level that appears on the show requires intricate physical maneuvering, and people who aren\u2019t regularly used to moving their bodies in that way run the risk of injury. Frankly, age can play a factor as well,\u201d noted veteran reality television talent agent, Marc Marcuse, of Reel Management.\nAnd given that the show has been in-momentum for an impressive 16 years, he added the pros have had few injuries considering the time it has been on the air.\n\u201cKeep in mind that although the dance moves the amateurs do are advanced for them, they\u2019re really fairly standard for the pros,\u201d added Marcuse. \u201cWhen a professional has been dancing like that for so long, muscle memory kicks in and keeps them fairly safe.\u201d\nA rep for the show did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nChoosing the correct floor for dance is important for health, safety and artistic performance.\nWhether for the world\u2019s leading dance companies or classes in school, the same fundamental criteria apply.\nExpecting children to dance on a hard, unyielding surface can lead to a variety of ankle and shin stress-related injuries that may also reduce a dancer\u2019s career in the longer term.

RNA silencing-based immunity is the cornerstone of plant and invertebrate defense against viral pathogens, and examples of host defense mechanisms and numerous viral counterdefense mechanisms exist. Recent studies indicate that RNA silencing might also play an active role in the context of a mammalian virus infection. We show here that a mammalian virus, human adenovirus, interacts with RNA silencing pathways during infection, as the virus produces microRNAs (miRNAs) and regulates the expression of Dicer, a key component of RNA silencing mechanisms.\nOur work demonstrates that adenovirus encodes two miRNAs within the loci of the virus-associated RNA I (VA RNA I). We find that one of these miRNAs, miR-VA \u201cg\u201d, enters into a functional, Argonaute-2 (Ago-2)-containing silencing complex during infection. Currently, the cellular or viral target genes for these miRNAs remain unidentified. Inhibition of the function of the miRNAs during infection did not affect viral growth in a highly cytopathic cell culture model. However, studies from other viruses implicate viral miRNAs in the establishment of latent or chronic infections.\nAdditionally, we find that adenovirus infection leads to the reduced expression of Dicer. This downregulation does not appear to be dependent on the presence of VA RNA or its associated miRNAs. Rather, Dicer levels appear to inversely correlate with the level of viral replication, indicating that another viral gene product is responsible for this activity. Misregulation of Dicer expression does not appear to influence viral growth in a cell culture model of infection, and also does not lead to gross changes in the pool of cellular miRNAs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RNA silencing pathways are active participants in the process of infection with human adenovirus.",

    "passages": [
      {
        "passage": "To work with vendors, VARs have to become authorized and meet certain requirements. For example, some vendors like HubSpot require partners to hit yearly revenue targets, or take technical and sales training programs and become certified sellers.\nFor example, when customers are researching software, they may find that the software they need doesn\u2019t exist in one package; a VAR can help customize the software to their specific requirements. VARs are particularly helpful for certain industries. In fact, many VARs specialize in certain industries such as the financial or healthcare industries, so they understand the regulations and technical requirements of their customers, and they can provide customized software with greater detail and efficiency because of their knowledge of a specific industry. These VARs also have the background knowledge and data to understand what your market\u2019s pain points are at each stage of the funnel.\nWhile the Value Added Reseller Channel is a popular choice, the traditional VAR model may not be the right choice for all SaaS products. Not to worry, just like putting a porsche engine in a old VW campervan, you can also customize your VAR partner model with an engine that suits your software. You may be able to choose one of the following options:\n- Advocate Partners offer a low-touch partnership where your software will be recommended to the partner\u2019s customers only when it makes sense.\n- Referral partners will pass leads to your company in exchange for commission on either the lead or the sale.\n- Strategic partners offers a higher level of partnership where your company will work more closely with a partner company towards common goals aligned with the same messaging and brand values.\nAt Roketto, being a VAR partner with Hubspot has proven to be a most valuable asset for our customers. Using Hubspot marketing software makes our process more efficient and gives us immediate access to the information we need to develop an effective inbound marketing strategy for our customers that engages at each level of the buyer journey.",

        "passage": "As a SaaS company, you know that using channel sales can generate more business and increase revenue without hiring a sales team. However, it is important to choose a sales channel that suits your business model, and even better if the channel you choose adds value for your potential customer and can help you guide them through the software buying process.\nThere are three common types of channel relationships that SaaS companies can use. Cost, flexibility and market adaptability are three major factors that will determine which channel to choose, and you need to understand which channel relates best to your customers\u2019 requirements. The three sales channels are:\nApplication Developer Model\nThe Application Developer Model is slightly different in that the vendor directly supports the customer and the customer pays the vendor. However, a third party can help the customer set up or customize the vendor\u2019s software. For example, Zoho CRM sells its service directly to customers and customers pay them directly.\nBrokerage Channel Model\nThe Brokerage Channel Model helps customize software for customers. This may entail bundling or stacking software to customize a solution for customers; this method can also include account management. It\u2019s similar to an insurance broker sourcing and building a policy for you and works best for simple SaaS products that focus on high transactional requirements.\nValue Added Reseller (VAR)\nVAR provides customers with a fully customized software service. The reseller builds, operates, services and supports and also invoices the customer. The reseller will then pay a license fee or royalties back to the vendor or in some cases the customer can pay the license fee directly to the vendor.\nFor example, Roketto is a HubSpot Certified Partner, which means that we can sell HubSpot Licenses to our clients. Clients who buy a HubSpot license through Roketto are usually going to work with us for inbound marketing services, and the Hubspot software helps us in our service delivery, marketing strategy and with measuring and tracking results.\nAnd because Roketto is a VAR certified partner with Hubspot, we can provide them with a special link that lets them save money on the regular $3000 onboarding fee. The client will pay HubSpot directly, but we will provide the client with training and support. However, we are the reseller who makes the sale to the client on the behalf of Hubspot.",

        "passage": "Even though a VAR will sell your product and probably market it, the SaaS company still plays the biggest role and will reap great benefits from marketing efforts to create demand for their products.\nEngage Buyers in the Software Evaluation Process\nFor these SaaS companies that need to promote a new product or stand out from the competition, inbound marketing can help engage buyers at every level of the buyer journey by delivering information that relates to their research. When the buyer is at the evaluation stage of the journey, you can help customers realize that your software is the answer to their problems and that it is the best choice on the market by publishing content that answers the questions and concerns they may have. For instance, when the buyer is going through the software evaluation process, you could publish a software buyer guide that informs the buyer of the pros and cons of similar software products on the market.\nJust as we take stock of what we want and need when buying a car, and then research each vehicle before heading to the car dealers, buyers will conduct over 60% of their research online before contacting a seller. According to TechTarget 65% of IT buyers will consume at least four pieces of content before contacting the vendor, and the 2014 B2B Buyer Behavior Survey from Demand Gen states that over 61% of buyers will choose the vendor that supplied relevant information at each stage of their journey.\nIt\u2019s all about building trust in your product and company. Therefore, it makes sense to invest on inbound marketing content that provides the research material your customers are searching for.\nMarketing software can help you manage your inbound marketing strategy.\nMarketing software can help you plan your content, meet deadlines and coordinate your team to develop content that is specific to buyers at each stage of the funnel.\nThe software will also help track engagement and the progression of buyers through the funnel, which helps you create and repurpose content and send the information to the buyer just when they need it most.\nSelecting a channel partner to work with can be hugely valuable in amplifying your message and increasing your reach. Many SaaS startups recognise the advantage in partnering with larger companies that have a more established brand name, a broader network, and a larger sales and marketing team.\nSaaS and the Value Added Reseller Channel\nSaaS companies that choose the VAR channel can offer customers the added assurance of a one-stop shop of customized software and ongoing support. On top of IT services, the VAR channel may also offer customers professional services such as consulting, design and training.",

See The Cha(lle)nging World of Value-added Resellers. Thus, Microsoft has opted for a hybrid subscription hosted model named Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA) program, which is a \"monthly rental of ERP\" in which Microsoft and its partners are increasing deployment options for customers. Namely, partner VARs and independent software vendors (ISVs) can provide Microsoft Dynamics ERP products (which will remain in a single-tenant architecture for the foreseeable future) as a service and as a monthly fee, with the on-premise switch option if necessary. Time will only tell whether this customer choice will be more important to customers than the above mentioned potential benefits of true multi-tenant SaaS deployments.\nDiscrete, \"to order\" manufacturing companies in the high-tech, electronics, capital equipment, and automotive sectors with annual revenues up to $50 million (USD), and smaller subsidiaries of larger companies, should evaluate GSInnovate as a cost-effective option for up to a few dozen users. Similar manufacturers with fifty or more users should consider, instead, the traditional on-premise glovia.com ERP system, which should have a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) for these larger organizations that require much deeper and broader functional scope. However, such companies still pondering to use SaaS for the short term because of IT resources or financial constraints might find GSInnovate a practical transitional choice before migrating the on-premise system (since Glovia grants a full credit for what they have spent on the hosting arrangement).\nGlovia.com is well suited for upper mid-market companies with multiple locations and multiple business units in diverse markets. It is also suitable for organizations with versatile, discrete manufacturing styles (mixed-mode) within the automotive, capital equipment, electronics, telecommunications, and similar industries. Companies needing software to address mixed-mode manufacturing (from engineer-to-order [ETO] and complex projects through to high-volume and repetitive), projects and contracts, and service management may want to include Glovia on an initial list of vendors for a particular ERP software selection.",

Using Hubspot marketing software makes our process more efficient and gives us immediate access to the information we need to develop an effective inbound marketing strategy for our customers that engages at each level of the buyer journey.\n\nAs a SaaS company, you know that using channel sales can generate more business and increase revenue without hiring a sales team. However, it is important to choose a sales channel that suits your business model, and even better if the channel you choose adds value for your potential customer and can help you guide them through the software buying process.\nThere are three common types of channel relationships that SaaS companies can use. Cost, flexibility and market adaptability are three major factors that will determine which channel to choose, and you need to understand which channel relates best to your customers\u2019 requirements. The three sales channels are:\nApplication Developer Model\nThe Application Developer Model is slightly different in that the vendor directly supports the customer and the customer pays the vendor. However, a third party can help the customer set up or customize the vendor\u2019s software. For example, Zoho CRM sells its service directly to customers and customers pay them directly.\nBrokerage Channel Model\nThe Brokerage Channel Model helps customize software for customers. This may entail bundling or stacking software to customize a solution for customers; this method can also include account management. It\u2019s similar to an insurance broker sourcing and building a policy for you and works best for simple SaaS products that focus on high transactional requirements.\nValue Added Reseller (VAR)\nVAR provides customers with a fully customized software service. The reseller builds, operates, services and supports and also invoices the customer. The reseller will then pay a license fee or royalties back to the vendor or in some cases the customer can pay the license fee directly to the vendor.\nFor example, Roketto is a HubSpot Certified Partner, which means that we can sell HubSpot Licenses to our clients. Clients who buy a HubSpot license through Roketto are usually going to work with us for inbound marketing services, and the Hubspot software helps us in our service delivery, marketing strategy and with measuring and tracking results.\nAnd because Roketto is a VAR certified partner with Hubspot, we can provide them with a special link that lets them save money on the regular $3000 onboarding fee. The client will pay HubSpot directly, but we will provide the client with training and support. However, we are the reseller who makes the sale to the client on the behalf of Hubspot.\n\nResell our SaaS solutions integrated with your services\nGrow your services and reach new markets as a VAR Partner\nAs a One Network VAR partner you will have the resources and knowledge to build expertise on One Network SaaS solutions. VARs can resell One Network applications to One Network customers as well as new customers. One Network is building ecosystems of consultants and ISVs around our industry cores to encourage specialization and tailoring of services and solutions that encapsulate the nuances of the target industry. Key industries include Automotive, Food Services, High Tech, CPG, Retail, Healthcare, Military, Logistics, and Pharma. One Network charges VARs a monthly fee per user and per business transaction for each application sold.\nRequest to Join Our VAR Partner Program\nIf you have any questions, please email email@example.com and we\u2019ll get back to you.\n\nEven though a VAR will sell your product and probably market it, the SaaS company still plays the biggest role and will reap great benefits from marketing efforts to create demand for their products.\nEngage Buyers in the Software Evaluation Process\nFor these SaaS companies that need to promote a new product or stand out from the competition, inbound marketing can help engage buyers at every level of the buyer journey by delivering information that relates to their research. When the buyer is at the evaluation stage of the journey, you can help customers realize that your software is the answer to their problems and that it is the best choice on the market by publishing content that answers the questions and concerns they may have. For instance, when the buyer is going through the software evaluation process, you could publish a software buyer guide that informs the buyer of the pros and cons of similar software products on the market.\nJust as we take stock of what we want and need when buying a car, and then research each vehicle before heading to the car dealers, buyers will conduct over 60% of their research online before contacting a seller. According to TechTarget 65% of IT buyers will consume at least four pieces of content before contacting the vendor, and the 2014 B2B Buyer Behavior Survey from Demand Gen states that over 61% of buyers will choose the vendor that supplied relevant information at each stage of their journey.\nIt\u2019s all about building trust in your product and company. Therefore, it makes sense to invest on inbound marketing content that provides the research material your customers are searching for.\nMarketing software can help you manage your inbound marketing strategy.\nMarketing software can help you plan your content, meet deadlines and coordinate your team to develop content that is specific to buyers at each stage of the funnel.\nThe software will also help track engagement and the progression of buyers through the funnel, which helps you create and repurpose content and send the information to the buyer just when they need it most.\nSelecting a channel partner to work with can be hugely valuable in amplifying your message and increasing your reach. Many SaaS startups recognise the advantage in partnering with larger companies that have a more established brand name, a broader network, and a larger sales and marketing team.\nSaaS and the Value Added Reseller Channel\nSaaS companies that choose the VAR channel can offer customers the added assurance of a one-stop shop of customized software and ongoing support. On top of IT services, the VAR channel may also offer customers professional services such as consulting, design and training.\n\nAlso, customers may see the value of a direct sales team that understands the manufacturing market as well as the types of problems specific to small businesses.\nHowever, history has shown that value added resellers (VARs) are critical to penetrating the local markets with their regional touch and knowledge. See The Cha(lle)nging World of Value-added Resellers. Thus, Microsoft has opted for a hybrid subscription hosted model named Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA) program, which is a \"monthly rental of ERP\" in which Microsoft and its partners are increasing deployment options for customers. Namely, partner VARs and independent software vendors (ISVs) can provide Microsoft Dynamics ERP products (which will remain in a single-tenant architecture for the foreseeable future) as a service and as a monthly fee, with the on-premise switch option if necessary. Time will only tell whether this customer choice will be more important to customers than the above mentioned potential benefits of true multi-tenant SaaS deployments.\nDiscrete, \"to order\" manufacturing companies in the high-tech, electronics, capital equipment, and automotive sectors with annual revenues up to $50 million (USD), and smaller subsidiaries of larger companies, should evaluate GSInnovate as a cost-effective option for up to a few dozen users. Similar manufacturers with fifty or more users should consider, instead, the traditional on-premise glovia.com ERP system, which should have a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) for these larger organizations that require much deeper and broader functional scope. However, such companies still pondering to use SaaS for the short term because of IT resources or financial constraints might find GSInnovate a practical transitional choice before migrating the on-premise system (since Glovia grants a full credit for what they have spent on the hosting arrangement).\nGlovia.com is well suited for upper mid-market companies with multiple locations and multiple business units in diverse markets. It is also suitable for organizations with versatile, discrete manufacturing styles (mixed-mode) within the automotive, capital equipment, electronics, telecommunications, and similar industries. Companies needing software to address mixed-mode manufacturing (from engineer-to-order [ETO] and complex projects through to high-volume and repetitive), projects and contracts, and service management may want to include Glovia on an initial list of vendors for a particular ERP software selection.\n---End Context---\n\n--Question--\nWhat are the different types of VAR partnership models available for SaaS products?\n\nInstructions:\n- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.\n- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.\n\n--Response Rules--\n- Response should be a json with key 'answer'",

    "answer": "Architecture in Hitchcock's Rear Window is crucial for creating tension as it both enables and confines the protagonist, L.B. Jefferies, who is fixated on observing his neighbors through their windows. His physical entrapment due to a broken leg heightens the claustrophobic atmosphere, mirroring his psychological entrapment within his apartment and his voyeuristic obsession. The window itself serves as a barrier and a portal, simultaneously isolating Jefferies from the real world while allowing him an exaggerated view into the lives of others. This setup not only builds suspense about the unfolding events across the courtyard but also reflects the broader themes of surveillance, invasion of privacy, and the blurred lines between curiosity and intrusion.",

    "question": "When did Germany become a unified country, and what cultural challenges did this unification bring?",
    "passages": [
      {
        "passage": "Last time, we looked at the historical context for artwork in late nineteenth century Germany. In 1871, Germany officially became a unified country. This time, we\u2019ll look at the cultural ramifications of the unification and how it impacted art.\nAlthough German-speaking princes had been allied for centuries, the individual provinces needed to strengthen their commitment in order to counter military and economic competition from other countries such as Austria and France. But just because the people in the new country spoke German and shared much in the way of their cultural identity didn\u2019t mean that they felt like a big happy family. And the disruptive forces of the industrial revolution did nothing to help the sense of confusion and frustration.\nThe people of the German Empire needed to ask themselves: what does it mean to be German? The imagery on Mettlach steins of the time offers some interesting answers to that question.\nSome steins use inspiration from the distant past for their subject matter. This shows a pride in the traditions of German culture\u2014with roots back to the middle ages\u2014as well as nostalgia for a simpler time. This past is often called \u201caltdeutschen\u201d or \u201cold Germany\u201d. When it appears in art, it is called historicism.\nFor instance, at the beginning of this post is a beautiful stein that shows a medieval knight mounted on a majestic white horse enjoying a tankard of beer. The romantic notion of the past is echoed in the lid in the shape of a castle turret.\nThis large-scale pitcher shows successful German hunters in extravagant Renaissance dress\u2014just look at that ermine trim!

As Maura O\u2019Connor points out, the different fates of Germany and Italy in the nineteenth century illustrates the unevenness of economic and political change.\nUnification of Italy, and its freedom from foreign occupiers, was achieved in 1861 through the military intervention of Napoleon\u2019s nephew, Napoleon III, together with King Victor Emanuel of Sardinia (Piedmont), who became King of a united Italy through a series of plebiscites (Venice and Rome were not incorporated into the Kingdom until 1866 and 1870 respectively).

In 1871, Germany officially became a unified country. This time, we\u2019ll look at the cultural ramifications of the unification and how it impacted art.\nAlthough German-speaking princes had been allied for centuries, the individual provinces needed to strengthen their commitment in order to counter military and economic competition from other countries such as Austria and France. But just because the people in the new country spoke German and shared much in the way of their cultural identity didn\u2019t mean that they felt like a big happy family. And the disruptive forces of the industrial revolution did nothing to help the sense of confusion and frustration.\nThe people of the German Empire needed to ask themselves: what does it mean to be German? The imagery on Mettlach steins of the time offers some interesting answers to that question.\nSome steins use inspiration from the distant past for their subject matter. This shows a pride in the traditions of German culture\u2014with roots back to the middle ages\u2014as well as nostalgia for a simpler time. This past is often called \u201caltdeutschen\u201d or \u201cold Germany\u201d. When it appears in art, it is called historicism.\nFor instance, at the beginning of this post is a beautiful stein that shows a medieval knight mounted on a majestic white horse enjoying a tankard of beer. The romantic notion of the past is echoed in the lid in the shape of a castle turret.\nThis large-scale pitcher shows successful German hunters in extravagant Renaissance dress\u2014just look at that ermine trim! The man on this side is toasted by none other than the ancient goddess of the hunt, Diana, who sits on top of a beer barrel.\nA noble couple in elegant dress from the 16th century is featured on this pitcher.

The rise in the production of manuscripts in Lyons at the beginning of the 16th century is paralleled most notably with the appearance of a printing press there in 1473. Commerce in Lyons also flourished with the arrival of the French court during the Italian Wars in 1494, which made Lyons the second center of the Kingdom of France and a veritable hub for commercial and artistic exchange.\nMore than thirty illuminated manuscripts are now recognized as the work of the Master of the Entry of Francis I. In addition to fifteen Books of Hours, including a luxurious example for Philibert de Vitry (Geneva, BPU, MS Lat. 367), the artist is credited with ten office books, which include a Missal for the church of the Order of Saint John of Rhodes illuminated for Charles Aleman de la Rochechenard, called the Rhodes Missal (London, Museum of the Order of Saint John); a Missal for the Abbey of Saint-Claude in Jura (Paris, Assembl\u00e9e national, MS 10); the Pontifical of Bishop Louis Guillard d'\u00c9picheli\u00e8re, almoner to Francis I (Paris, BnF, MS Lat. 955), and a Benedictional-Evangeliary for the use of Saint-Nizier of Lyons (Lyon, BM, MS 5136). The Master of the Entry of Francis I also decorated numerous instructive, literary, and historical works, including a Kalender of Shepherds (Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, MS 167), a Tr\u00e9sor de sapience (Chantilly, Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, MS 147), and the Pas d'armes de Sandricourt (Paris, BnF, Arsenal, MS 3958)\nThe color palette and the execution of the classically-inspired architectural frames that surround the textual incipits and accompany the miniatures reveal the artist's training in the workshop of the Master of Alarmes de Mars, active in Lyons from the 1480s until the early 1510s.",

Caravans of goods from the north and east traveled to these fairs, which lasted for several weeks. Bankers from Florence and wealthy merchants settled in Lyon. They built luxury mansions and stores.\nBy the end of the 16th century, King Francois allowed Lyon the right to produce silk to compete with Venice. Silk production became a massive industry and a significant employer all through the 19th century.\nWith the introduction of Christianity in 177 AD, the earliest Christian community (and the earliest persecutions) was in Lyon. In 1032, it was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire and finally incorporated into the Kingdom of France in 1312.\nYou've had a snapshot of where Lyon is, its geography and some historical perspective. Remember Lyon's geography, 2 Rivers, 2 Hills and a Peninsula. Its geography is its history.\nOn the east bank of the Saone is the historic city of Lyon or Vieux Lyon. The Vieux, all 1000 plus acres of it, is the largest Renaissance town in France and the second largest in Europe after Venice. It was the first area to be declared a cultural site in France in 1954. In 1998, Vieux Lyon, together with the hills of Fourviere and Croix-Rousse, and the Presqu'ile became UNESCO World Heritage sites.\nThere are three sections to the Vieux, Saint-Jean, Saint-Paul, and Saint-Georges. You will notice that most names on the Vieux will be saints or martyrs.\nThe Saint-Jean section dates back to the Middle Ages. The prominent part of this neighborhood is the Cathedrale de Saint-Jean (St. John the Baptist) and the square around it. The cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Lyon, also the \"Primat de Gauls.\" The Primat or the First of Gaul designation refers to Lyon being the first diocese in France.\nDedicated to St. John the Baptist, it took about 300 years (1180-1476) to construct this Romanesque and Gothic style church. The church is a significant feature in the famous Festival of Lights held every year the week of December 8. More on this later.",

The noted food critic Curnonsky referred to the city as \"the gastronomic capital of the world\", a claim repeated by later writers such as Bill Buford.

The rise in the production of manuscripts in Lyons at the beginning of the 16th century is paralleled most notably with the appearance of a printing press there in 1473. Commerce in Lyons also flourished with the arrival of the French court during the Italian Wars in 1494, which made Lyons the second center of the Kingdom of France and a veritable hub for commercial and artistic exchange.\nMore than thirty illuminated manuscripts are now recognized as the work of the Master of the Entry of Francis I. In addition to fifteen Books of Hours, including a luxurious example for Philibert de Vitry (Geneva, BPU, MS Lat. 367), the artist is credited with ten office books, which include a Missal for the church of the Order of Saint John of Rhodes illuminated for Charles Aleman de la Rochechenard, called the Rhodes Missal (London, Museum of the Order of Saint John); a Missal for the Abbey of Saint-Claude in Jura (Paris, Assembl\u00e9e national, MS 10); the Pontifical of Bishop Louis Guillard d'\u00c9picheli\u00e8re, almoner to Francis I (Paris, BnF, MS Lat. 955), and a Benedictional-Evangeliary for the use of Saint-Nizier of Lyons (Lyon, BM, MS 5136). The Master of the Entry of Francis I also decorated numerous instructive, literary, and historical works, including a Kalender of Shepherds (Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, MS 167), a Tr\u00e9sor de sapience (Chantilly, Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, MS 147), and the Pas d'armes de Sandricourt (Paris, BnF, Arsenal, MS 3958)\nThe color palette and the execution of the classically-inspired architectural frames that surround the textual incipits and accompany the miniatures reveal the artist's training in the workshop of the Master of Alarmes de Mars, active in Lyons from the 1480s until the early 1510s.\n\nLyon(redirected from Lyons, Archdiocese of)\nAlso found in: Thesaurus, Medical, Financial, Encyclopedia.\nLy\u00b7onor Ly\u00b7ons (l\u0113-\u014dN\u2032, ly\u00f4N)\nA city of east-central France at the confluence of the Rhone and Sa\u00f4ne Rivers north of Marseille.

In the 15th century, King Charles VIII allowed Lyon the right to hold trade fairs four times per year. Caravans of goods from the north and east traveled to these fairs, which lasted for several weeks. Bankers from Florence and wealthy merchants settled in Lyon. They built luxury mansions and stores.\nBy the end of the 16th century, King Francois allowed Lyon the right to produce silk to compete with Venice. Silk production became a massive industry and a significant employer all through the 19th century.\nWith the introduction of Christianity in 177 AD, the earliest Christian community (and the earliest persecutions) was in Lyon. In 1032, it was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire and finally incorporated into the Kingdom of France in 1312.\nYou've had a snapshot of where Lyon is, its geography and some historical perspective. Remember Lyon's geography, 2 Rivers, 2 Hills and a Peninsula. Its geography is its history.\nOn the east bank of the Saone is the historic city of Lyon or Vieux Lyon. The Vieux, all 1000 plus acres of it, is the largest Renaissance town in France and the second largest in Europe after Venice. It was the first area to be declared a cultural site in France in 1954. In 1998, Vieux Lyon, together with the hills of Fourviere and Croix-Rousse, and the Presqu'ile became UNESCO World Heritage sites.\nThere are three sections to the Vieux, Saint-Jean, Saint-Paul, and Saint-Georges. You will notice that most names on the Vieux will be saints or martyrs.\nThe Saint-Jean section dates back to the Middle Ages. The prominent part of this neighborhood is the Cathedrale de Saint-Jean (St. John the Baptist) and the square around it. The cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Lyon, also the \"Primat de Gauls.\" The Primat or the First of Gaul designation refers to Lyon being the first diocese in France.\nDedicated to St. John the Baptist, it took about 300 years (1180-1476) to construct this Romanesque and Gothic style church. The church is a significant feature in the famous Festival of Lights held every year the week of December 8. More on this later.\n\nLyon is the third-largest city of France. It is located in the country's east-central part at the confluence of the rivers Rh\u00f4ne and Sa\u00f4ne, about 470 km (292 mi) south from Paris, 320 km (199 mi) north from Marseille.\nThe city is known for its cuisine and gastronomy, and historical and architectural landmarks; part of it is a registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The noted food critic Curnonsky referred to the city as \"the gastronomic capital of the world\", a claim repeated by later writers such as Bill Buford. Renowned 3-star Michelin chefs such as Marie Bourgeois and Eug\u00e9nie Brazier developed Lyonnaise cuisine into a national phenomenon favoured by the French elite; a tradition which Paul Bocuse later turned into a worldwide success.\nThe bouchon is a traditional Lyonnais restaurant that serves local fare such as sausages, duck p\u00e2t\u00e9 or roast pork, along with local wines. Two of France's best known wine-growing regions are located near the city: the Beaujolais region to the north and the C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne region to the south.\nyon played a significant role in the history of cinema: it is where Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re invented the cinematograph in 1895.

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the prevalence of the disease is 9 times higher among women; however, the cause of this disparity is largely unknown, a recent study indicates.\nThe study, published in JCI Insight, examined the potential mechanisms promoting increased likelihood of autoimmunity in women as opposed to men. The study pointed to a skin-targeted overexpression of the female-biased transcription cofactor vestigial like family member 3 (VGLL3) as a potential contributor to autoimmunity. Previous research has indicated that women have more VGLL3 in their skin cells than men.\nAccording to the study, the researchers found that in mice, having too much VGLL3 in skin cells promoted an autoimmune response that extended beyond the skin. In the mouse model, overexpression of VGLL3 drove an autoimmunity-prone transcriptional signature similar to that observed in female skin, causing inflammation and activation of type I IFN signaling that mimics cutaneous lupus, according to the researchers.\nAdditionally, the researchers noted that extra VGLL3 in the skin cells appeared to change expression levels of a number of genes important to the immune system, including many of the same genes altered in autoimmune diseases. In mice with excess VGLL3, their skin became scaly and raw and they produced antibodies against their own tissues.\n\u201cVGLL3 appears to regulate immune response genes that have been implicated as important to autoimmune diseases that are more common in women, but that don\u2019t appear to be regulated by sex hormones,\u201d lead study author Johann Gudjonsson, MD, PhD, professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan Medical School, said in a press release. \u201cNow, we have shown that overexpression of VGLL3 in the skin of transgenic mice is by itself sufficient to drive a phenotype that has striking similarities to systemic lupus erythematosus, including skin rash, and kidney injury.\u201d\nThe researchers concluded that the data support the assertion that overexpression of VGLL3 in female skin primes women for autoimmunity.

Having a family history of the condition raises risk for both genders and, interestingly, the connection is even stronger for women. A woman whose mother has or had arthritis is likely to develop the problem at the same age and in the same joints.\nRheumatoid Arthritis: A More Aggressive Immune System Raises Women\u2019s Risk\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is different from osteoarthritis in that the inflammation is an autoimmune reaction and unrelated to wear and tear on the joints. Three times as many women as men get RA. Also, women tend to be younger when they get RA and, as with osteoarthritis, their pain is worse.\nExperts believe there are two main reasons for the gender differences in RA. First, women get autoimmune diseases in far greater numbers than men \u2013 it\u2019s thought that the female immune system is stronger and more reactive. Second, it appears that hormones affect RA risk and flares. Many women with RA who get pregnant experience fewer or no symptoms at all, only to find that they reappear after the baby is born. And breastfeeding lowers the risk of developing RA; a woman who has breastfed for two years has reduced the risk she will ever get the condition by half.\n---End Context---\n\n--Question--\nWhy do women have different susceptibility to allergies and autoimmune diseases compared to men?\n\nInstructions:\n- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.\n- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.\n\n--Response Rules--\n- Response should be a json with key 'answer'",
    "answer": "Women have different susceptibility to allergies and autoimmune diseases compared to men due to various factors, including genetic predispositions, hormonal influences, and differences in immune system reactivity. The female immune system is generally stronger and more reactive, which can lead to a higher incidence of autoimmune diseases. Additionally, hormonal changes, particularly those related to pregnancy and menopause, can influence the risk and severity of these conditions.",

        "passage": "Last updated August 5, 1999\nMost California married couples own their homes as \u201cjoint tenants,\u201d because they want the surviving spouse to own the entire home, without any formal court proceeding to confirm the transfer.\nUnfortunately, owning property as \u201cjoint tenants\u201d can seriously affect the taxation of any subsequent sale of the property after the death of one spouse. This is because the U.S. Internal Revenue Code provides special treatment for property owned by a married couple as \u201ccommunity property,\u201d but not for similar property owned as \u201cjoint tenants.\u201d\nSpecial Tax Benefit for \u201cCommunity Property\u201d\nWhen someone dies, his or her heirs are treated as if they purchased the deceased person\u2019s property for its fair market value on the date of death. However, if the deceased person owned only a one-half interest as a \u201cjoint tenant,\u201d only that one-half interest receives this treatment (called an \u201cadjusted basis\u201d).\nThus, if a married couple, Richard and Joan, buy a house as \u201cjoint tenants\u201d for $400,000, the IRS considers that each paid $200,000 for a one-half interest. If Richard later dies, Joan automatically owns the entire house, and Richard\u2019s one half share of the house is revalued as of the date of his death. If the house was worth $1,500,000 when Richard died, then Joan is treated as if she paid $950,000 for the house \u2014 computed by adding her share of the purchase price ($200,000), to the value of Richard share when he died ($750,000).\nIn contrast, the IRS treats \u201ccommunity property\u201d as if it were owned completely by the deceased spouse, in applying this special \u201cadjusted basis\u201d rule. (For other purposes, such as computing estate taxes, only one-half of the value of community property is counted.) Therefore, if Richard and Joan bought their house as \u201ccommunity property\u201d for $400,000, and Richard later died, leaving his share to Joan, the entire house would be assigned a new \u201cbasis\u201d at current fair market value.\nThe result is that if Joan decides to sell the \u201cjoint tenancy\u201d house for $1,500,000 shortly after Richard\u2019s death, she would realize a taxable capital gain of $550,000 (the $1,500,000 sale price minus her $950,000 \u201cadjusted basis,\u201d computed two paragraphs above).",

        "passage": "However, each spouse has the right to dispose of/leave their ownership right in the property to an heir in their will.\nCommunity Property With Right Of Survivorship\nThis form of vesting title for a house or property owned together by spouses or domestic partners has one additional benefit: the right to survivorship. What that means is that when a husband and wife, for example, hold community property with right of survivorship and one of them dies, their remaining interest in the property does not pass to their descendants but remains with the living spouse. Sometimes, spouses or domestic partners vest title as community property with right of survivorship because of tax advantages it offers.\nAccording to the California Civil Code, joint tenancy is a form of vesting title to two or more persons with equal shares and interests. None of them have to be married or domestic partners, and they\u2019re subject to the right of survivorship in the surviving joint tenant(s). So when one of these two or more joint tenants dies, title to the property automatically and immediately vests in the name of the surviving tenant(s). With joint tenancy, the title must be acquired for all of these parties at the same time and by the same conveyance, with the document expressly declaring their intention to create a joint tenancy estate.\nTenancy In Common\nThis form of vesting title to a property allows for two or more co-owners just like joint tenancy. However, with tenancy in common they are allowed fractional \u2013or unequal \u2013 ownership, so they are owed that same proportion in income or profit it generates, as well as expenses. There are also no rights to survivorship, so if one tenant dies, the title does not automatically go to the remaining tenants, but can be vested to the deceased person\u2019s heirs. Each individual tenant may also sell/lease, or will their share of the property as they wish.\nIn California, you may also hold title to your house or property in a trust. A trust is an arrangement where the legal title to your property is transferred by a grantor to a person called a trustee, who holds and manages it according to the best interests of the beneficiaries. For that reason, a trust usually doesn\u2019t hold title in its own name, but title is vested to the trustee, while the trust still holds legal title and rights.",

        "passage": "The method of titling the ownership of property in California and elsewhere is generally an integral aspect of proper estate planning. By configuring the title to assets in designated ways during the life of the owner(s), estate planning can assure certain outcomes automatically on the death of an owner. The simplest form of ownership is where one individual owns the property in his/her name alone. If the asset is real estate, the single ownership model is called \"fee simple\" ownership, which represents the highest degree of unfettered ownership in real property.\nAssets owned as joint tenants with the right of survivorship represent ownership by the joint owners. For inheritance purposes, a deceased owner's share is automatically passed to the surviving joint tenant by operation of law. Assets titled this way do not pass through the decedent's estate but are automatically owned by the survivor. Assets owned individually in fee simple will pass to the decedent's heirs and must go through the decedent's estate at death.\nOwnership by tenants in common represents separate shares owned by each of the tenants. Thus, if there are three tenants in common owners of a parcel of real estate, the death of one tenant will pass that tenant's ownership interest onto that owner's heirs. The share of a deceased tenant in common will have to be reported by decedent's estate and treated as an estate asset.\nWhen an individual or married couple meet with an estate planning attorney to set up an estate plan, the attorney will explain and discuss the impact of the various ways of titling assets. Title to certain assets may be changed to conform to the owners' wishes for the most expedient way of transferring title at death. In some cases, title to an asset or assets will go into a living trust, which generally is a way of passing assets at death without going through the decedent's estate. In California and elsewhere, the issues to evaluate are usually too complex to justify do-it-yourself estate planning, and the matter should therefore be jointly undertaken in cooperation with an experienced estate planning attorney.\nSource: paulsvalleydailydemocrat.com, \"How to title your property\", Dan Barney, Oct. 25, 2017",

In California there are four different ways that property can pass to beneficiaries or heirs, depending on how your property is \u201ctitled\u201d.\n1. JOINT OWNERSHIP WITH SURVIVORSHIP RIGHTS: If property is titled as \u201cas joint tenants,\u201d or as \u201ccommunity property with rights of survivorship,\u201d the property will automatically pass to the joint owner upon your death. No probate will be necessary; instead only a death certificate and perhaps an Affidavit of Death will be required. Any Will you may leave has no effect on property held in joint ownership with survivorship rights. Do not add someone to title to your property as a joint owner as an estate planning device without first discussing it with an attorney. A joint owner\u2019s creditors may be able to reach the asset prior to your death; and joint tenancy ownership may reduce income tax \u201cstepped up basis\u201d benefits that would otherwise be available to your joint owner if they received the property from you via a different avenue. When the second joint owner dies, probate may be required if no further estate planning is completed.\n2. BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION: You are allowed to sign forms designating beneficiaries for certain property, usually retirement accounts, life insurance, and bank accounts. There is also a new \u201cTransfer on Death Deed\u201d in California for putting a beneficiary on real property. The property will automatically pass to the designated beneficiary upon your death. No probate is necessary for property having a designated beneficiary; instead only a death certificate and completion of a Claim form. Any Will you may leave has no effect on property passing to a designated beneficiary. If you have young children, you may want to name a custodian for them in the beneficiary designation: for example, \u201cJohn Doe, son, but if he is under the age of 18 then to Jane Doe as Custodian for John Doe until he attains age 18 under the California Uniform Transfers To Minors Act.\u201d You may select any age between age 18 and 25 as a Custodianship ending age.",

When one owner dies, that person\u2019s share immediately passes to the other owner(s) in equal shares, without going through probate. We\u2019ve all been told that Joint Tenancy is a simple and inexpensive way to avoid probate, and this is sometimes true. But the tax and legal problems of Joint Tenancy ownership can be mindboggling. The dangers of Joint Tenancy include the following:\nDanger #1: Only Delays Probate. When either joint tenant dies, the survivor \u2013 usually a spouse or a child \u2013 immediately becomes the owner of the entire property. But when the survivor dies, the property still must go through probate. Joint Tenancy doesn\u2019t avoid probate; it simply delays it.\nDanger #2: Two Probates When Joint Tenants Die Together. If both of the joint tenants die at the same time, such as in a car accident, there will be two probate administrations, one for the share of each joint tenant in the Joint Tenancy property as well as any other property they each may own.\nDanger #3: Unintentional Disinheriting. When blended families are involved, with children from previous marriages, here\u2019s what could happen: the husband dies and the wife becomes the owner of the property. When the wife dies, the property goes to her children, leaving nothing for the husband\u2019s children.\nDanger #4: Taxes. When you place a non-spouse on your property as a joint tenant, you are making a disposition of property and capital gains taxes may be due and owing in the year of the transfer into joint tenancy and you may be creating future taxes if the new joint owner already has a principal residence.\nDanger #5: Right to Sell or Encumber. Joint Tenancy makes it more difficult to sell or mortgage property because it requires the agreement of both parties, which may not be easy to get.\nDanger #6: Financial Problems. If either owner of Joint Tenancy property fails to pay income taxes, the Canada Revenue Agency can place a tax lien on the property. If either owner files for bankruptcy, the trustee in bankruptcy may be able to sell the property.\nDanger #7: Court Judgments.",

    "final_prompt": "\nBelow you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. \nPlease review the following texts carefully. \nWhile the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.\n\n---Begin Context---\nLast updated August 5, 1999\nMost California married couples own their homes as \u201cjoint tenants,\u201d because they want the surviving spouse to own the entire home, without any formal court proceeding to confirm the transfer.\nUnfortunately, owning property as \u201cjoint tenants\u201d can seriously affect the taxation of any subsequent sale of the property after the death of one spouse. This is because the U.S. Internal Revenue Code provides special treatment for property owned by a married couple as \u201ccommunity property,\u201d but not for similar property owned as \u201cjoint tenants.\u201d\nSpecial Tax Benefit for \u201cCommunity Property\u201d\nWhen someone dies, his or her heirs are treated as if they purchased the deceased person\u2019s property for its fair market value on the date of death. However, if the deceased person owned only a one-half interest as a \u201cjoint tenant,\u201d only that one-half interest receives this treatment (called an \u201cadjusted basis\u201d).\nThus, if a married couple, Richard and Joan, buy a house as \u201cjoint tenants\u201d for $400,000, the IRS considers that each paid $200,000 for a one-half interest. If Richard later dies, Joan automatically owns the entire house, and Richard\u2019s one half share of the house is revalued as of the date of his death. If the house was worth $1,500,000 when Richard died, then Joan is treated as if she paid $950,000 for the house \u2014 computed by adding her share of the purchase price ($200,000), to the value of Richard share when he died ($750,000).\nIn contrast, the IRS treats \u201ccommunity property\u201d as if it were owned completely by the deceased spouse, in applying this special \u201cadjusted basis\u201d rule. (For other purposes, such as computing estate taxes, only one-half of the value of community property is counted.) Therefore, if Richard and Joan bought their house as \u201ccommunity property\u201d for $400,000, and Richard later died, leaving his share to Joan, the entire house would be assigned a new \u201cbasis\u201d at current fair market value.\nThe result is that if Joan decides to sell the \u201cjoint tenancy\u201d house for $1,500,000 shortly after Richard\u2019s death, she would realize a taxable capital gain of $550,000 (the $1,500,000 sale price minus her $950,000 \u201cadjusted basis,\u201d computed two paragraphs above).\n\nHowever, each spouse has the right to dispose of/leave their ownership right in the property to an heir in their will.\nCommunity Property With Right Of Survivorship\nThis form of vesting title for a house or property owned together by spouses or domestic partners has one additional benefit: the right to survivorship. What that means is that when a husband and wife, for example, hold community property with right of survivorship and one of them dies, their remaining interest in the property does not pass to their descendants but remains with the living spouse. Sometimes, spouses or domestic partners vest title as community property with right of survivorship because of tax advantages it offers.\nAccording to the California Civil Code, joint tenancy is a form of vesting title to two or more persons with equal shares and interests. None of them have to be married or domestic partners, and they\u2019re subject to the right of survivorship in the surviving joint tenant(s). So when one of these two or more joint tenants dies, title to the property automatically and immediately vests in the name of the surviving tenant(s). With joint tenancy, the title must be acquired for all of these parties at the same time and by the same conveyance, with the document expressly declaring their intention to create a joint tenancy estate.\nTenancy In Common\nThis form of vesting title to a property allows for two or more co-owners just like joint tenancy. However, with tenancy in common they are allowed fractional \u2013or unequal \u2013 ownership, so they are owed that same proportion in income or profit it generates, as well as expenses. There are also no rights to survivorship, so if one tenant dies, the title does not automatically go to the remaining tenants, but can be vested to the deceased person\u2019s heirs. Each individual tenant may also sell/lease, or will their share of the property as they wish.\nIn California, you may also hold title to your house or property in a trust. A trust is an arrangement where the legal title to your property is transferred by a grantor to a person called a trustee, who holds and manages it according to the best interests of the beneficiaries. For that reason, a trust usually doesn\u2019t hold title in its own name, but title is vested to the trustee, while the trust still holds legal title and rights.\n\nThe method of titling the ownership of property in California and elsewhere is generally an integral aspect of proper estate planning. By configuring the title to assets in designated ways during the life of the owner(s), estate planning can assure certain outcomes automatically on the death of an owner. The simplest form of ownership is where one individual owns the property in his/her name alone. If the asset is real estate, the single ownership model is called \"fee simple\" ownership, which represents the highest degree of unfettered ownership in real property.\nAssets owned as joint tenants with the right of survivorship represent ownership by the joint owners. For inheritance purposes, a deceased owner's share is automatically passed to the surviving joint tenant by operation of law. Assets titled this way do not pass through the decedent's estate but are automatically owned by the survivor. Assets owned individually in fee simple will pass to the decedent's heirs and must go through the decedent's estate at death.\nOwnership by tenants in common represents separate shares owned by each of the tenants. Thus, if there are three tenants in common owners of a parcel of real estate, the death of one tenant will pass that tenant's ownership interest onto that owner's heirs. The share of a deceased tenant in common will have to be reported by decedent's estate and treated as an estate asset.\nWhen an individual or married couple meet with an estate planning attorney to set up an estate plan, the attorney will explain and discuss the impact of the various ways of titling assets. Title to certain assets may be changed to conform to the owners' wishes for the most expedient way of transferring title at death. In some cases, title to an asset or assets will go into a living trust, which generally is a way of passing assets at death without going through the decedent's estate. In California and elsewhere, the issues to evaluate are usually too complex to justify do-it-yourself estate planning, and the matter should therefore be jointly undertaken in cooperation with an experienced estate planning attorney.\nSource: paulsvalleydailydemocrat.com, \"How to title your property\", Dan Barney, Oct. 25, 2017\n\nHOW WILL MY PROPERTY BE TRANSFERRED AT MY DEATH?\nTransfer of your property on your death is controlled by the law of the State where you live, except that procedures for transferring real property (land) located in another State will be governed by the law of the State where the land is located. In California there are four different ways that property can pass to beneficiaries or heirs, depending on how your property is \u201ctitled\u201d.\n1. JOINT OWNERSHIP WITH SURVIVORSHIP RIGHTS: If property is titled as \u201cas joint tenants,\u201d or as \u201ccommunity property with rights of survivorship,\u201d the property will automatically pass to the joint owner upon your death. No probate will be necessary; instead only a death certificate and perhaps an Affidavit of Death will be required. Any Will you may leave has no effect on property held in joint ownership with survivorship rights. Do not add someone to title to your property as a joint owner as an estate planning device without first discussing it with an attorney. A joint owner\u2019s creditors may be able to reach the asset prior to your death; and joint tenancy ownership may reduce income tax \u201cstepped up basis\u201d benefits that would otherwise be available to your joint owner if they received the property from you via a different avenue.

We answer the question whether you really need to replace your car battery.\nHow Long Do Batteries Last?\nWhile batteries that are properly looked after can last as long as five years, most will become worn down and inoperable after around three. Just like the batteries in your laptop or smartphone, your car\u2019s battery will gradually become less effective with each subsequent charge, so you should be able to tell when your battery\u2019s performance starts dropping off.\nUnfortunately, as our vehicles get more technically advanced year on year, our batteries are put under an even bigger strain. Of course, battery technology is also getting more advanced, but it can\u2019t quite keep pace with the sheer volume of gadgets and gizmos that the average domestic vehicle has onboard these days.

But what are the sort of things that you should be looking out for? Here are three important signs that you car\u2019s battery might need replacing:\n- Your vehicle is taking a while to start: To start, your vehicle requires large amounts of energy, so if your battery isn\u2019t at its best, you\u2019ll probably know about it when you put your key in the ignition. Specifically, you want to listen out for your engine cranking more slowly than usual. This is a telltale sign that your battery is dying, and you will probably only get a few of these before it goes completely flat, so take your car to the garage if you notice this.\n- No power to the electrics: It\u2019s important to remember that your car\u2019s battery doesn\u2019t just start the engine, it has to start all of your car\u2019s onboard electrical systems, such as the lights, windows, heaters and all of the various computers.",

        "passage": "\u201cHow long should the battery in my car last?\u201d\nThat\u2019s a question we get asked a lot. The average car battery can last between 3-5 years, but the actual life of your battery depends on several factors.\n- The quality of the battery when first purchased. You don\u2019t have to spend a fortune, but don\u2019t be cheap about it.\n- How well you maintain it. Battery maintenance goes a long way toward longer life. Include your battery on your checklist whenever you take your car in for routine check ups. Don\u2019t forget the cables and terminals and keep them clean.\n- The weather. Check the top of your battery to see the temperature specifications. If you live in a cold climate make sure you purchase one intended for your area. Cold weather reduces the cranking power of your battery so an older battery will experience more issues in the winter than a new one. Car batteries can even freeze and explode so if you think your battery is frozen proceed with caution.\n- Your car usage. Turn off all your car\u2019s accessories before you turn off your car. The heater and A/C, radio, wipers, etc. can really drain your battery even when the car is off. Even consistently short trips can shorten battery life.\nAnd since it\u2019s still the middle of winter we\u2019ll pass on some more battery tips from our friends at AAA:\n- Turn off all accessories at night before turning the ignition switch off.\n- Make sure battery case and brackets are free of corrosion.\n- Keep the car in a garage overnight, if available.\n- Check the tension and condition of your fan belt. If it is loose, it can affect the battery\u2019s ability to recharge.\n- Watch and listen for battery-drain warning signs. If headlights dim when idling but brighten when you rev the engine it could signal an electrical system problem. If you hear a grinding or clicking when you turn the ignition to the crank position, your battery may be weak\n- Lastly, if your battery does not initially turn the engine over on the first try in the morning, turn the ignition key on and wait one minute before cranking the engine again. This gives the battery chemicals time to jell and energize the battery terminals.\nIf you\u2019re wondering if your battery is on its last legs bring your car into Sallas Auto Repair and we\u2019ll be happy to check it as well as your car\u2019s other systems.

With this in mind, if you have a newer car, don\u2019t expect your battery to last five years, no matter how well you look after it.\nSee if Tyres Northampton can help you.\nGet in touch with our team to find out more.Contact Us\nSigns That Your Battery Needs Replacing\nSo, now you know that it\u2019s important to keep an eye on your car\u2019s battery. But what are the sort of things that you should be looking out for? Here are three important signs that you car\u2019s battery might need replacing:\n- Your vehicle is taking a while to start: To start, your vehicle requires large amounts of energy, so if your battery isn\u2019t at its best, you\u2019ll probably know about it when you put your key in the ignition. Specifically, you want to listen out for your engine cranking more slowly than usual. This is a telltale sign that your battery is dying, and you will probably only get a few of these before it goes completely flat, so take your car to the garage if you notice this.\n- No power to the electrics: It\u2019s important to remember that your car\u2019s battery doesn\u2019t just start the engine, it has to start all of your car\u2019s onboard electrical systems, such as the lights, windows, heaters and all of the various computers.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the new amp draw using the basic power equation:\nAmps Draw (in A) = 800W/ 240V = 3.33 A\nAs we can see, the amp draw is no longer 6.67 A; it\u2019s 3.33 A. When we increase voltage, we need fewer amps to get the same electrical power (wattage). Based on this, we can now calculate how long will a 200 Ah battery be able to power an 800 W 240 V air conditioner:\n200 Ah Battery Life = 200 Ah / 3.33 A = 60 hours\nAs we can see, because the amp draw is halved, the battery life is increased. That\u2019s because an 800 W air conditioner on 240V requires fewer amps than an air conditioner on 120V.\nNow we know how to calculate the amps from watts. We can use this knowledge to calculate the second vital input into the Battery Life Calculator:\nBattery Life Calculator (Insert Battery Capacity And Amp Draw)\nWhen you figured out how big a battery you have (battery capacity in Ah), and how many amps does a device you want to hook on the battery runs on, you can input both numbers in this calculator. As a result, you will get how long will a battery last (in hours):\nYou can pretty much calculate the battery life for any kind of battery powering any kind of electric device.\n\n\u201cHow long should the battery in my car last?\u201d\nThat\u2019s a question we get asked a lot. The average car battery can last between 3-5 years, but the actual life of your battery depends on several factors.\n- The quality of the battery when first purchased. You don\u2019t have to spend a fortune, but don\u2019t be cheap about it.\n- How well you maintain it. Battery maintenance goes a long way toward longer life. Include your battery on your checklist whenever you take your car in for routine check ups. Don\u2019t forget the cables and terminals and keep them clean.\n- The weather. Check the top of your battery to see the temperature specifications. If you live in a cold climate make sure you purchase one intended for your area. Cold weather reduces the cranking power of your battery so an older battery will experience more issues in the winter than a new one. Car batteries can even freeze and explode so if you think your battery is frozen proceed with caution.\n- Your car usage. Turn off all your car\u2019s accessories before you turn off your car. The heater and A/C, radio, wipers, etc. can really drain your battery even when the car is off. Even consistently short trips can shorten battery life.\nAnd since it\u2019s still the middle of winter we\u2019ll pass on some more battery tips from our friends at AAA:\n- Turn off all accessories at night before turning the ignition switch off.\n- Make sure battery case and brackets are free of corrosion.\n- Keep the car in a garage overnight, if available.\n- Check the tension and condition of your fan belt. If it is loose, it can affect the battery\u2019s ability to recharge.\n- Watch and listen for battery-drain warning signs. If headlights dim when idling but brighten when you rev the engine it could signal an electrical system problem. If you hear a grinding or clicking when you turn the ignition to the crank position, your battery may be weak\n- Lastly, if your battery does not initially turn the engine over on the first try in the morning, turn the ignition key on and wait one minute before cranking the engine again. This gives the battery chemicals time to jell and energize the battery terminals.\nIf you\u2019re wondering if your battery is on its last legs bring your car into Sallas Auto Repair and we\u2019ll be happy to check it as well as your car\u2019s other systems. Don\u2019t be caught dead (battery wise, that is) when a winter storm or cold snap comes and you have to be on the move.\n---End Context---\n\n--Question--\nWhat information do I need to calculate how long a battery will last?\n\nInstructions:\n- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.\n- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.\n\n--Response Rules--\n- Response should be a json with key 'answer'",
    "answer": "To calculate how long a battery will last, you need to know two main pieces of information: the battery capacity (measured in amp-hours or Ah) and the current draw (measured in amps or A) of the device you want to power. You can then use a battery life formula or a battery life calculator that divides the battery capacity by the device's current draw to find out how many hours the battery will last.",

Whereas the Swamp Rabbit trail has been a boon to walkers, runners, bikers and skaters, I have enjoyed several more rustic trails that provide resources for more rugged hiking and/or horseback riding.\nOne of my favorites is North Mills Recreation Area. This is located in North Carolina, south of Asheville.
