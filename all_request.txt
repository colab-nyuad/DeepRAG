                                "What is the program for?\nThe Rural Passenger Transportation Technical Assistance Program, funded through a Rural Business Enterprise Grant by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is designed to assist rural communities enhance economic growth and development by improving community transportation services. Public transit can help support a wide range of other economic development initiatives. Program objectives include helping small and emerging businesses and stimulating economic development through new and improved transportation programs. The program provides planning assistance for facility development, transit service improvements and expansion, new system start-up, policy and procedure development, marketing, transportation coordination, training and public transit problem solving activities.\nWho qualifies for assistance?\nTo qualify for technical assistance, a project must be located in a rural area with a popu lation of less than 50,000. Requests for technical assistance may be submitted by private for-profit or non-profit organizations or agencies. Public entities are not eligible recipients; however, eligible recipients can usually be identified in most communities. The project must also benefit new or existing small and emerging businesses.\nHow are projects selected?\nApplications for technical assistance are submitted directly to CTAA for review. Potential projects are reviewed to establish eligibility, and are scored and ranked according to the selection criteria described below:\n- Will project help create or preserve jobs or small businesses?\n- Is project located in an economically distressed area?\n- Is project likely to be implemented after technical assistance has been provided?\n- Are project goals directly linked to economic development?\n- Will technical assistance be utilized innovatively to help resolve transportation issues and economic concerns?\n- Is there local consensus and community support for the project?\nHow is the technical assistance program administered?\nOnce an application has been received, reviewed and tentatively approved by CTAA, a draft scope of work and project budget will be prepared and submitted to USDA's Rural Business-Cooperative Service for approval. Upon receipt of funding approval from USDA for a specific project, CTAA will notify the applicant and arrange for an initial site visit. Projects with more limited scopes may be eligible for short term technical assistance which has a streamlined review process.\nDuring the site visit, CTAA staff will conduct a comprehensive project analysis and tech nical assistance needs assessment. CTAA will gather additional information about the proposed project and will work closely with the applicant and local officials in assessing the transportation needs of the community. Participants will explore ways in which the technical assistance program might be applied to help meet the transportation, small business and economic development objectives of the community.\nBased on information collected during the initial site visit and needs assessment, CTAA will develop a refined scope of work which will define the project approach, work tasks, deliverable products and various \"roles\" of all project participants. If the project requires assistance from independent consultants, a consultant work plan , budget and request for proposals may be developed by CTAA.\nDuring the course of a major project, CTAA staff and consultants will develop recommendations and solutions that are responsive to the community's needs."

                                "A safety concept for removing brain tumours developed at the Inselspital leads to the best results for patients anywhere in the world, in honour of which it was awarded a prize at this year\u2019s European Congress of Neurosurgery in Madrid.\nOperations close to the brain\u2019s motor centres are common (one in three brain tumours) and risky. If the surgeon has to remove a tumour from this area, incidental damage to motor pathways risks causing the patient to lose the use of an arm or leg. In order to prevent this, in 2014 neurosurgeons at the Inselspital in Bern developed a new safety instrument \u2013 the first of its kind in the world \u2013 which enables surgeons to operate near motor pathways or centres without endangering the safety of the operation.\nLong-term study proves patient safety\nNeurosurgeons in Bern have already used this method to operate on more than 200 patients, 182 of whom were included in a long-term study. This study showed that the surgical instrument permits enables tumours to be removed from areas close to the brain\u2019s motor centres and pathways at low risk, significantly reducing the chance of long-term paralysis.\nMore specifically, the rate of permanent restrictions in mobility after the operations conducted in Bern was just 3%, one of the lowest in the world. The procedure also excelled at an international level, with Dr Kathleen Seidel and Professor Andreas Raabe receiving the prize for the best paper at the annual meeting of the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies in Madrid on 21 October.\n\u201cOur experiences from a large number of operations led us to develop this new instrument, which has transformed tumour surgery in this critical region,\u201d says Professor Andreas Raabe, Physician-in-Chief of Neurosurgery. \u201cWe are very honoured to receive this award, as it reflects the outstanding results we have achieved in brain tumour surgery in Bern with our new hybrid probe.\u201d\nBern\u2019s hybrid probe soon to be used worldwide\nThe new surgical instrument can suction out the tumour tissue while stimulating the motor centres with an electrical radar, which tells the surgeon how close they are to these areas. In order to alert him or her to potential dangers, it uses acoustic signals similar to those found in electronic parking aids. The instrument therefore allows surgeons to operate while receiving constant feedback on their position, resulting in considerable improvements to patient safety.\nStudy author Dr Kathleen Siedel explains the instrument\u2019s practical benefits: \u201cKnowing exactly how close you are to a motor pathway leads to a significant reduction in surgical risk.\u201d\nNeuroscientists at the Inselspital in Bern have dedicated years of their work to improving brain tumour surgery. They teamed up with the German company Inomed to develop the hybrid probe, which can create a risk map in real time. This safe surgical instrument has now been approved by the medical authorities and will soon be in use all around the world.\nProfessor Andreas Raabe, Director and Physician-in-Chief of the Department of Neurosurgery, +41 (0)31 632 35 35, Andreas.Raabe@insel.ch.\nProspective study of continuous dynamic mapping of the corticospinal tract during surgery of motor eloquent intraaxial brain tumors, Kathleen Seidel, J\u00fcrgen Beck, Philippe Schucht, Andreas Raabe, Department of Neurosurgery, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.\nMonika Kugemann | idw - Informationsdienst Wissenschaft\nNew insight into the brain\u2019s hidden depths: Jena scientists develop minimally-invasive endoscope\n27.11.2018 | Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Photonische Technologien e.

                                "As competition between sports and esports heats up, traditional sports teams make headway into gaming, CES panel\nEsports and traditional sports fandom have converged during the Covid-19 pandemic, pushing companies on both sides \u2014 and their sponsors \u2014 to experiment with new types of activations and partnerships to reach this growing combined audience.\nThe topic of sports\u2013esports crossover, and the resulting competition between the sectors to capture brands\u2019 marketing budgets, was the subject of a CES 2022 panel yesterday. But Nate Clancy, one of the panelists and a vp of business development at the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, thinks competition isn\u2019t the best word to describe what\u2019s going on.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more that a rising tide lifts all ships, especially when looking at some of our product offerings like NFTs. It\u2019s really about what community and what type of fans you have,\u201d Clancy said. \u201cSo, from FTX\u2019s perspective \u2014 and I think all of crypto \u2014 I don\u2019t necessarily see it as a rivalry, but more as evaluating things on a one-by-one basis and trying to find the unique partnership that makes the most sense.\u201d\nIn June 2021, FTX signed a $210 million naming rights deal with leading esports team TSM, but the company has ample involvement in the traditional sports industry as well, including a $10 million partnership with the NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors announced last month. \u201cThey have the Golden Guardians; they have an NBA2K team as well,\u201d Clancy said. \u201cAnd I know that played into the decision to partner with the Golden State Warriors.\u201d\nAcross traditional sports, teams are diversifying their offerings to include gaming and esports. Prominent association football club Manchester City has longstanding partnerships with Electronic Arts esports organization FaZe Clan, but the team took its biggest leap into esports yet by signing 16-year-old Fortnite player Aidan \u201cThreats\u201d Mong in October 2021. \u201cOur fans in this space, and our potential fans that we might attract \u2014 they\u2019ll see through you unless you\u2019re going all-in,\u201d said Gavin Johnson, media director of the club\u2019s parent company City Football Group.\nSome observers attribute the convergence of sports and esports fandom to the Covid-19 pandemic. Covid-19 lockdowns led scores of professional athletes to pivot to Twitch streaming in 2020, encouraging their teams to invest further in the gaming space. With traditional-sports athletes and their fans joining the live-streaming boom, many sports fans have gained a new appreciation for competitive gaming. \u201cOne-quarter of sports fans \u2014 26 percent \u2014 watch esports, and it\u2019s continuing to grow,\u201d said Asaf Davidov, vp of measurement and insights for Disney Advertising Sales. \u201cThat\u2019s bigger than some other growing sports, like NASCAR, wrestling and international soccer within the U.S. market. And it\u2019s just a growing segment of the population: 82 percent of esports fans predict that, in 20 years, it\u2019ll be as popular as football in the U.S.\u201d\nThough esports is a nascent industry, some sports teams view competitive gaming as an arguably safer bet in a world in which live sporting events feel more at-risk than ever. Pre-pandemic, NBA 2K League teams met in-person in New York to compete; during the pandemic, it\u2019s been relatively simple for the teams to switch to an online competition schedule. \u201cWhat we were able to learn in that process is that our sport can pretty much weather any storm,\u201d said Wesley Acuff, director of esports of Hawks Talon GC, the NBA 2K affiliate of the NBA\u2019s Atlanta Hawks. No matter how long the pandemic persists, esports teams will be able to compete more or less without interruptions, and beleaguered traditional sports teams have taken notice.\nAnd while traditional sports teams have been making strides into the gaming community, esports teams still have an advantage when it comes to partnering with newer and tech-focused brands in areas that already have natural crossover with gaming, such as cryptocurrency and NFTs. For Clancy and his colleagues at FTX, the younger and more plugged-in ethos of esports teams could make the difference between a $210 million partnership and a $10 million partnership. Many of them are self-identified gamers, so they naturally gravitate toward the modes of competition and entertainment that engage with their favorite pastime.\n\u201cSome of the videos that TSM makes are just the athletes playing Jenga, or trying to guess a player\u2019s rank based on a very short clip,\u201d Clancy said. \u201cSo they really match the whole ethos of FTX and how we approach our marketing plan and our identity.\u201d\nMore in Marketing\nDigiday+ Research assesses how brands and influencers are using Shorts to reach new audiences and what types of Shorts videos create the most buzz for marketers.\nYesterday, Snapchat marked its return to in-person agency roadshows, sending company representatives to Horizon Media\u2019s Manhattan office to showcase a Snap-designed video game intended to capture the essence of what it\u2019s like to work at an agency \u2014 and how Snapchat can be part of the process.\nBabylist, TodayTix Group and Liquid Death grow their in-house teams as they try to save money, have more control\nAs in-housing settles in as a mainstay, some marketers push for complete control."

                                "Antidotes for Addiction\nDrug addiction is a serious disease. In the U.S. alone, it affects millions of people and claims numerous lives. This staggering epidemic of substance abuse has led to an abundance of treatment options. Just what are they, and how do they help?\n1 in 10\nThe estimated number of Americans (ages 12+) who use drugs or alcohol daily\nAmericans with clinical substance addiction\nAnnual medical and economic costs from substance abuse\nA basic understanding of popular drugs is important to understanding treatment, since treatment options can vary depending on the drug or drugs of choice.\nNegative effects: Drowsiness, slurred speech, nausea, loss of coordination, impaired memory\nSubstance abusers/addicts: 18,658,000\nNegative effects: Increased heart rate, slowed reaction time, increased appetite, panic attacks\nSubstance abusers/addicts: 4,090,000\nNegative effects: Dizziness, sedation, feeling of heaviness, slowed breathing and heart rate\nSubstance abusers/addicts: 227,000\nNegative effects: Increased heart rate, increased blood pressure and body tremors, paranoia, anxiety, psychosis\nSubstance abusers/addicts: 1,549,000\nNegative effects: Tremors, increased energy, irritability, anxiety, psychosis, reduced appetite\nSubstance abusers/addicts: 626,000\nNegative effects: Depression, anxiety, impaired memory, muscle aches, disorientation, nausea, dissociation\nSubstance abusers/addicts: 1,546,000\nTreatment Options: Traditional or Modern?\nJust like any medical practice, there are tried and true versions of therapy and newer, lesser known methods. Let\u2019s take a look at the treatment methods for addicts.\nAddicts currently receiving treatment\nAverage cost of 28-day inpatient treatment program\nTypes of Treatment\nInpatient rehab with detox\nBest for: Users with daily, life-threatening addictions who do not live in conditions conducive to treatment.\nHow it works: A typical stay is 28 or 30 days. Patients go through clinical detox, attend mandatory therapy sessions and stay in a sober living space.\nBest for: Users who have family or loved ones who can encourage and help maintain sobriety.\nHow it works: A patient must report to meetings and therapy sessions conducted outside a hospital setting. Programs often are as long as inpatient treatments, 28-30 days.\nCognitive behavioral therapy\nBest for: Users who have previously or continuously relapsed.\nHow it works: Through therapy, users are exposed to their abused substance in order to build their confidence in refusing to indulge. This is purely a reactionary, physical therapy that does not include psychotherapy.\nBest for: Users who have experienced past traumas that have contributed to their addiction.\nHow it works: Talk therapy is utilized to uncover traumatic memories and/or experiences at the root of an individual\u2019s addiction.\nDrug-replacement treatment (methadone therapy)\nBest for: Users of severely addictive, intravenous drugs; typically heroin and methamphetamine.\nHow it works: Though only considered a temporary fix, the substance being abused is replaced with methadone or an equally sedating drug to offset the symptoms of withdrawal.\nBest for: Users who believe their addiction is purely psychological and can be overcome with willpower and not medicine.\nHow it works: Patients are hypnotized and convinced that they do not need or desire the substance they abuse. For narcotic users, hypnosis is often paired with methadone therapy.\nBest for: Users who need ongoing treatment and outpatient rehabilitation.\nHow it works: Users attend regular meetings, sometimes for years, and go through the process of changing their entire lifestyles along with their drug abuse.\nBest for: Users who are interested in health and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to replace their consistent drug abuse.\nHow it works: This therapy utilizes the view that drug addiction is due to an imbalance of chemicals in the body. By focusing on nutrition and balance, users attempt to battle their biochemistry to maintain healthy lifestyles and overcome addiction.\nBest for: Users who believe in new-age remedies.\nHow it works: Holistic doctors often use a mix of complementary medicines, equine therapy, acupuncture, neurofeedback, massage and more to treat addiction and its psychological effects.",
                                "Reading Time: 7 minutes\nThe class of opioid drugs include illicit opioids like heroin and prescription painkillers, such as morphine, Vicodin, Percocet, OxyContin, tramadol, and fentanyl. They work by binding to opioid receptors, which are responsible for regulating pain, stress, temperature, respiration, endocrine activity, gastrointestinal activity, mood, and motivation. Opioids alleviate pain and can create a sense of relaxation as well as feelings of euphoria. Because of these desirable effects, opioids are highly addictive, and many people who begin taking them for medical reasons end up misusing them and developing an opioid addiction.1,2\nSigns and Symptoms of Opioid Addiction\nOpioids are highly addictive because of the intense feelings of euphoria and pain-relief they produce. Prescription opioids are classified as a Schedule II drug, which means it has a high potential for misuse, dependence, and addiction, while heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance since it has no accepted medical use.3\nOpioid tolerance develops quickly, leading you to take increasingly higher doses of the drug to experience the same effects. Tolerance can then speed up the development of physiological dependence, which occurs when your body requires the presence of an opioid to function normally. Both tolerance and dependence play a major role in contributing to the development of an opioid addiction.4\nDiagnostic Criteria for Opioid Use Disorder\nOpioid use disorder is a condition characterized by repeated, compulsive opioid use despite negative consequences. It is the formal term for an opioid addiction.5\nCommon signs of opioid use disorder include:5\n- Experiencing strong cravings for opioids\n- Failing to quit or control opioid use despite efforts to do so\n- Taking higher or more frequent doses of opioids than intended\n- Continuing use despite physical or psychological problems caused or worsened by use\n- Continuing use despite negative effects on relationships, work, school, etc.\n- Using opioids in physically hazardous situations, such as while driving\n- Spending a great deal of time obtaining and using opioids as well as recovering from their effects\n- Neglecting important hobbies or recreational activities in favor of opioid use\n- Developing a tolerance\n- Experiencing opioid withdrawal symptoms when you suddenly stop taking them\nWhen you abruptly quit or reduce opioid use, you may experience a myriad of unpleasant or distressing withdrawal symptoms, such as:5\n- Nausea and vomiting\n- Muscle aches\n- Runny nose or teary eyes\n- Dilated pupils\n- Goose bumps\n- Profound sweating\n- Excessive yawning\nCall our 24/7 helpline at 800-926-9037 (Who Answers?) if you are worried you or someone you know may be addicted to opioids. Our caring and compassionate treatment support advisors can help you get the treatment you need.\nSigns of Opioid Abuse and Addiction\nSome signs that someone you know may be misusing opioids include:5\n- Initial euphoria followed by apathy\n- Depressed mood\n- Drowsiness (being \u201con the nod\u201d)\n- Slurred speech\n- Impaired memory or attention\n- Pupillary constriction\n- Impaired judgment\nOther signs of opioid addiction are specific to the individual\u2019s method of administration, such as injecting or snorting. If your loved one is injecting opioids, you may notice the following:5\n- Collapsed veins\n- Puncture marks\n- Track lines\n- Peripheral edema\n- Circular scars\nAdditionally, people who inject opioids or other drugs are at an increased risk of contracting HIV or hepatitis C, as well as bacterial endocarditis, an infection of the heart lining.5\nMeanwhile, snorting opioids can lead to other harmful effects, such as:5\n- Nose bleeds\n- Irritation of the nasal mucosa\n- Perforation of the nasal septum\nTaking an opioid like morphine, oxycodone, or heroin over a long period can cause nerve damage in the brain that prevents cells from producing endorphins. This can create an inability to manage pain as a result, which can lead you to take even more of the drug to achieve the same effect.6\nWho is at Risk of an Opioid Addiction?\nIf you have issues with severe, chronic pain, your physician may prescribe an opioid as a part of your treatment. Anyone who takes an opioid for the treatment of pain is at risk of developing an opioid addiction. The risk of addiction increases significantly when you misuse the medication by taking higher or more frequent doses than prescribed, mixing it with other substances, or using it in a way other than directed (e.g., injecting or snorting).10\nOther risk factors for opioid misuse and addiction may include:11\n- Personal/Family history of substance misuse\n- Young age\n- History of criminal activity or legal problems, including DUIs\n- Regular contact with high-risk people or high-risk environments\n- Problems with past employers, family members, and friends\n- Risk-taking or thrill-seeking behavior\n- Heavy tobacco use\n- History of severe depression or anxiety\n- Stressful situations\n- Prior drug or alcohol rehabilitation\nHow to Treat an Opioid Addiction\nMedical Detox for Opioid Withdrawal\nThe first step on the continuum of opioid addiction treatment is often medical detox, in which you receive 24/7 medical care to manage your opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Medical detox often takes place in a hospital setting, giving you access to a team of medical professionals who can keep you safe and comfortable throughout withdrawal. They will administer an opioid withdrawal medication, such as methadone or buprenorphine, which alleviates withdrawal symptoms and cravings. They\u2019ll also provide supportive care, such as intravenous fluids or symptomatic medications for symptoms that aren\u2019t managed by withdrawal medications.\nInpatient and Outpatient Rehab\nOnce you complete opioid detox, the next step is to transition into a rehab program. Opioid addiction treatment occurs in either an inpatient or outpatient setting. Inpatient treatment involves residing at the treatment center for the entire program. You receive around-the-clock treatment and care, with little to no exposure to triggers. Inpatient provides more structure and intensiveness, which many people find beneficial.\nConversely, outpatient opioid addiction treatment offers more flexibility and less scheduling conflicts. You live at home while attending therapy and counseling during the day. The time commitment for outpatient ranges from just a few hours per week to several hours per day. If your opioid addiction is more severe but you are unable to attend inpatient, you may want to opt for a partial hospitalization program (PHP) or intensive outpatient program (IOP).\nUltimately the right treatment setting for you depends on your opioid addiction, other substance use, mental health condition, physical health, priorities, schedule, and more.\nDuring treatment, the treatment team may include an opioid addiction treatment medication, known as medication-assisted treatment (MAT).\nMedications for opioid addiction recovery may include:12\n- Naltrexone: Naltrexone binds to opioid receptors in the brain and blocks the sedative and euphoric effects of opioids, which reduces cravings.\n- Methadone: Methadone is a full opioid agonist that eases opioid cravings. Although it\u2019s an opioid, it doesn\u2019t cause a euphoric high.\n- Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone): Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist, which alleviates opioid cravings without producing a high, and naloxone is an opioid antagonist, which reduces the risk of diversion and misuse.\nOpioid Addiction Therapies\nOpioid addiction treatment programs may vary depending on treatment philosophy and approach. For example, some rehabs integrate holistic treatment modalities while others may take a faith-based approach. But all quality opioid rehabs should utilize evidence-based therapies and approaches, such as:\n- Individual therapy: This involves meeting with a therapist one on one to help you understand the reasons behind your opioid misuse and to overcome your struggles. This is an opportunity to work on developing trust in another person and learning to speak openly about yourself and begin developing new, healthier coping skills.\n- Group therapy: Group therapy is an important part of treatment. It can help to know someone else is experiencing similar issues and that you are not alone. Overcoming the isolation that is typically part of opioid addiction is a key factor in recovery. This provides peer support, which is essential. Group therapy allows you to express your emotions and receive feedback that helps you learn new coping skills and to develop new, healthy relationships.\n- Family therapy: A person\u2019s family is their support system and relationship issues may need to be addressed. Family therapy can help people work out their differences and develop healthier connections. Support from your family helps you become more open to your loved ones and provide healing and closure.\nFor help finding an opioid rehab, call our confidential helpline at 800-926-9037 (Who Answers?) to speak to a rehab support specialist about options in your area.\n- Johns Hopkins Medicine.

                                "Telescope Eyepiece Fundamentals\nThere is no faster way to degrade your telescope's optics than to pair it with a low- quality bargain-bin eyepiece. Choosing the right eyepieces for your telescope goes beyond just basic magnification. Poorly made telescope accessories and eyepieces can reduce a crisp, beautiful image to a sad, fuzzy mess. There are a number of factors that go into making a great telescope eyepiece, but choosing the right eyepiece for your telescope also requires some forethought and consideration. Before we list our favorite telescope eyepieces for sale, we\u2019ll cover some of the basics you need to know to make an informed decision.\nHow to Choose the Best Eyepieces for Your Telescope\nWhenever possible, you should choose an eyepiece with an optical quality that matches or exceeds your telescope. You have invested in the optics of your telescope, don't cheapen your observing experience by skimping on the eyepieces that will bring your view into focus. Keep in mind that the final image you see depends on several factors, including some things you can\u2019t control (like the seeing conditions) and others you can, such as the optical quality of each component in your optical chain.\nHere are some terms you should familiarize yourself with before buying telescope eyepieces online eyepiece shopping:\nThe most important measurement of an eyepiece, the focal length is the distance that light travels through the eyepiece to reach your eye, but most importantly, it is the determining factor in the resulting magnification of an image through your telescope. Keep in mind that the higher the focal length of the eyepiece the lower the resulting magnification will be. See the \"Eyepiece Math\" section below.\nApparent Field of View\nCommonly called out as AFOV in degrees. This is the calculated angular diameter of light you can see through the eyepiece. Anything less than 40 degrees is considered narrow and is best suited to observing the planets or the moon. 80 degrees and above is considered wide. A wide field of view provides a more immersive visual experience, especially for large deep sky objects.\nTrue Field of View\nThe angle of the sky that your eyepiece will produce when paired with your particular telescope also represented in degrees.\nThe barrel of an eyepiece is the section that slides into the focuser or diagonal, and it generally comes in one of two sizes: 1.25\" or 2\". Sure, there is such a thing as a .965\" eyepiece, but they are getting scarce since most telescope manufacturers around the world switched over to the standard quite some time ago, which is, you guessed it, 1.25\".\nThe distance your eye must be from the eyepiece to view a focused image. Too short and eyelashes will brush the glass, too long and you might find yourself bobbing and weaving to find the image. Comfortable eye relief is a matter of personal taste, though most will find eyepieces with 10-20mm easy to use. Eyeglass wearers will appreciate a longer (more than 15mm) eye relief if they like to keep their glasses on while observing.\nTelescope Eyepiece Magnification Formula\nSimple Math For Determining The Focal Length For Your Telescope Eyepiece\nAn eyepiece is defined by its focal length, apparent field of view, and barrel size, but how do you know whether it's right for your telescope? First of all, you need to know the magnification that will result if you pair an eyepiece you are considering with your telescope. The math is easy division; take your telescope's focal length in millimeters and divide it by the focal length of the eyepiece, also in millimeters. For instance: a telescope with a focal length of 500mm divided by a 10mm eyepiece will yield 50X magnification. Simple.\nAnother way to tackle it is to figure out a magnification you\u2019d like to have available for your telescope and then pick an eyepiece that would provide that magnification. This can be achieved by dividing the telescope\u2019s focal length by the desired magnification to solve for the eyepiece focal length you would need to achieve that magnification. For example: If you have an 8\" f/10 SCT, it has a focal length of 2032mm. Let\u2019s say you\u2019d like an eyepiece that gives you 250X. 2032 divided by 250 is about 8, so you know an 8mm eyepiece would get you close to that desired 250X. Easy!\nBefore you sit down with your calculator and come up with a set of eyepieces that will be perfect for your telescope, there are a couple of things to consider when it comes to magnification. The physical limits of a telescope and the sky above hinder us from increasing magnification without restriction. A good rule of thumb is to keep maximum magnification to approximately 40X or 50X for every inch of aperture up to about 300X for average seeing conditions. If you are lucky enough to observe in excellent, clear and dry skies you could push this limit to 400X or even 450X, but that is not normally the case. Why? Because you're not just magnifying the object you are looking at, you are magnifying everything between your telescope and that object. In most locations, this means a lot of pollutants, moisture, and atmospheric turbulence. Imagine zooming into a photo on your computer, the image remains sharp up until a point and then it becomes distorted and blurry. The \"stuff\" that gets between your telescope and your target (celestial or terrestrial) does that same thing to your view if you magnify the image beyond what the conditions can tolerate. Terrestrial viewing has so much atmosphere, heat, dust, and pollutants to deal with that magnification can rarely go beyond 60X! That is why most any spotting scope you\u2019ll find on the market has a max magnification of 60 times as far as your eye can see. Now you know why.\nPS: For years, the general rule of thumb for maximum magnification per inch of the aperture was 50X - 60X, which is higher than we stated above. Problem is, this generous guideline assumes better seeing conditions than most people have to contend with today. In our experience, this has disappointed many an amateur astronomer who found that their high magnification eyepiece didn\u2019t come to focus 95% of the time. We are not saying that your conditions might support higher power than normal, it might. However, we will stick with our 40X - 50X up to 300X max for most people on most nights.\nNow that you know the math needed, let\u2019s use our 8\" SCT example again. 8 inches means we technically have a magnification limit of 400X, but let's say you live in the suburbs at a low elevation and the seeing conditions are just so-so. We stick with our 300X limit. For a high power eyepiece (2032/300) you could go with a 6mm or 7mm eyepiece. For a medium power eyepiece (approximately 150X) a 13mm or 14mm eyepiece would do. For a low power eyepiece (about 75X), which are great for finding and centering or observing very large and close objects like the Moon or Sun, an eyepiece between 25mm and 30mm would work well. Fill in from there as your budget allows and to support the types of objects you love to observe most.\nDetermining True Field of View\nBut what about that field of view, you may ask? And what's the difference between Apparent Field of View (AFOV) and True Field of View (TFOV)?\nApparent field of view is the width or angle of the view through the eyepiece before it's paired up with a telescope. This is the measurement that is advertised for most eyepieces\u202682\u00ba, 68\u00ba, etc. True field of view is the width of the view when it's paired with a telescope, and it\u2019s called \"true\" because you won\u2019t be doing much observing with just an eyepiece alone! True field of view is found by dividing the apparent field of view of the eyepiece by it's resulting magnification. The number you get from this equation is a much smaller measurement in degrees that relate to the apparent size of objects in the night sky.\nRevisiting our 8\" SCT\u2026when we use a 7mm eyepiece with an 82-degree apparent field of view in our telescope, it will yield a magnification of approximately 290X. So take the apparent field of view of 82 and divide it by 290 (the resulting magnification) and you\u2019ll get .28 degrees. The full Moon is about 0.5 degrees, so you would see about half of the moon's disc with this eyepiece choice. If you wanted to see the entire full moon at once, you would need a lower power eyepiece and/or a wider apparent field of view. In the end, the width of view is really a matter of personal choice.\nCommon Telescope Eyepiece Designs\nPlossl: The most ubiquitous eyepiece design you'll come across and for good reason. The Plossl is a good all-around eyepiece design, is well suited for generic use and is relatively inexpensive to make. This is why many telescopes come standard with at least one Plossl eyepiece. This doublet design has an apparent field of view of 50-degrees or wider but can suffer from short eye relief making them difficult to use for some eyeglass wearers.\n\"Wide\": A generic classification attached to a huge number of specialized designs produced by companies such as Celestron, Explore Scientific and Meade. Typically anything with more than 5 lens elements and an apparent field of view larger than 80 degrees could be dubbed a \"wide\" eyepiece design, but there are also 68- and 72- degree eyepieces that have been designated as \"Wide\" as well. You'll find wide eyepieces cover a large number of brand names.\nZoom: An eyepiece with a variable focal length. Zoom eyepieces are well suited for outreach use, terrestrial observing and solar observing thanks to the convenience of a range of magnifications without requiring a physical change of eyepiece. In instances where you need to quickly reduce and increase magnification repeatedly, zoom eyepieces will save you from having to switch out eyepieces in rapid succession.\nOrthoscopic: Also called Abbe eyepieces, Orthoscopics have a narrow field of view but produce nearly perfect images thanks to a simple but effective lens configuration. Orthoscopic eyepieces are best for lunar and planetary observing.\nTele Vue Proprietary Designs: Al Nagler, of the eyepiece manufacturer Tele Vue, has designed several eyepieces, the most famous of which is the Nagler. Nagler eyepieces have 8 elements that are fully corrected for astigmatism and chromatic aberration and have a wide 82-degree field of view. The Nagler has spawned new or modified designs since its creation in 1979, including the Ethos, which offers up to 120 degrees AFOV, and it's more compact offspring, the Delos, which is a 72- degree eyepiece with a long eye relief of 20mm. While well corrected and excellently made, eyepieces containing a large number of elements are heavier than other designs. A focuser and mount that can handle the additional weight are necessary.\nCaring for Your Eyepieces\nOnce you've selected your eyepieces and are investing in those great views, you want to keep them clean and safe. Screw-top bolt style cases are the easiest way to add the first layer of protection to your eyepieces. Eyepiece bolt-style cases by StarDust Covers are made from a specialized plastic that will not off-gas or stick.\nWhen you're traveling you will want an additional level of protection for your eyepieces, and a hard case is the best way to do so. For premium level protection, accessory cases by Vanguard are waterproof and shockproof, providing assurance that your eyepieces are safe in the back of your vehicle. If you need a light-duty carry case, a soft-sided case designed to carry eyepieces is available from Explore Scientific or Tele Vue.\nKeeping telescope eyepieces clean does need to be done with care. Be sure to use cleaning fluid that's meant for the delicate coatings on lenses and soft, lint-free brushes and cloths. Never apply cleaning fluid directly to your optics (unless you have a waterproof model); instead, put some fluid onto a soft, lint-free cloth and rub gently. A LensPen is great to have on hand for a quick dusting and removing the occasional spot or watermark.\nCleaning fluid and cleaning kits from Orion, Vanguard, Zhumell or Vortex are safe to use with your eyepieces but remember, be gentle and only do as much as absolutely necessary to keep dust, fingerprints and eyelash marks from building up on your optics, and always blow or brush off loose particles before cleaning the optical surface with a cloth or other cleaning accessory that requires pressure on the glass to do its job. Even the most careful cleaning with top-notch products will, over time, erode your coatings, so be gentle and clean as little as possible. This holds true for optics of any type\u2026camera lenses, binoculars, telescope mirrors, you name it.\nRecommended Telescope Eyepieces\nMembers of our customer service team recommend eyepieces to amateur astronomers of all levels each and every day, and we take their needs into consideration before making those recommendations.

                                "A Guide on Choosing the Best Lenses for Telescope\nThe lenses or eyepieces allow you to focus the light collected by the telescope, so you can observe a sharp image of the object or area where the telescope is pointing. It may seem like a small link in the chain, but it has a big effect on your telescope\u2019s optical system, and finding the right eyepieces will greatly increase its potential.\nWith so many options to choose from, getting the right set of eyepieces for you and your telescope can seem a bit tricky. This guide offers some insights and explanations about the different types of Lenses for Telescope, specifications and how it all connects to optimize your astronomy and astrophotography sessions!\nFocal Length and Magnification\nFocal length is an important specification that must be considered when determining the magnification, also known as power, of the eyepiece and telescope with which it is used. The following formula will help you determine the magnification based on the specifications of your eyepiece and telescope:\nMagnification = Focal length of the telescope (mm) / Focal length of the eyepiece (mm)\nThe 20 mm eyepiece of the 2000 mm telescope (2000/20) gives you 100 power (100x), which makes objects appear 100 times closer to you through the telescope than they look to your naked eye.\nField of view: Apparent and true\nThe apparent field of view of the eyepiece (AFOV) is expressed in degrees (\u00b0). This is how much of the sky can be seen from end to end only through the eyepiece. AFOV range from narrow (25 \u00b0 \u2013 30 \u00b0) to extremely wide angle (80 \u00b0 or more).\nThe true field of view of the eyepiece is the angle of the sky that is visible through the eyepiece when attached to the telescope. The true field can be calculated using the following formula:\nTrue field = visible field / magnification\nSuppose, for example, that you have an 8-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope with a focal length of 2000 mm and a 20 mm eyepiece with a field of view of 50 \u00b0. The magnification will be 2000 mm / 20 mm = 100x. The true field would be 50 \\ 100 or 0.5 \u00b0 \u2013 approximately the same visible diameter as the full moon.\nLong Eye Relief\nEye Relief refers to the distance between your eye and the eyepiece lens when the image is in focus. The relief of the eyes is traditionally proportional to the focal length: The shorter the focal length, the shorter the relief of the eyes. However, some of the more modern eyepiece designs provide long-eye relief, regardless of the focal length, which is especially useful for those who wear glasses. If you want to keep your glasses while using a telescope, the relief of the eyepiece is an important feature that must be taken into account (we recommend looking at the eyepieces for long-eyed relief).\nHow many Lenses for Telescope do I really need?\nAlthough there is no specific number of Lenses for Telescopes to own, with a few different telescope eyepieces you have a better chance of reaching the optimal power for the particular object you are observing, given the sky conditions at the time. You will usually want to start with low power (i.e., a long focal length of the eyepiece, for example 25 mm or 30 mm) to get the object in the field of view of the telescope. Then you can try an eyepiece with a little more power (shorter focal length, maybe 18 mm or 15 mm) and see if the view looks better. If this happens, swap the eyepiece for even more power, etc., until you reach this \u201csweet spot\u201d where the brightness of the image, the scale of the image, and the amount of visible detail combine to form the most pleasing view.\nWhat about Barlow lenses?\nYou can also choose a long focal length eyepiece with comfortable eye relief and use image amplifiers to increase power, such as a Barlow lens. Barlow increases the effective focal length of the lens, increasing the magnification. The idea is that two eyepieces and a Barlow will give you the flexibility to zoom in on four eyepieces and will give higher magnifications with less powerful eyepieces.\nThe use of different eyepieces can significantly increase the flexibility and functionality of any telescope.\nWhat is a Zoom Eyepiece?\nThe zoom eyepieces are a single eyepiece that you can adjust to change its focal length, which changes the magnification. You just insert the eyepiece into your telescope and simply rotate the zoom eyepiece barrel to zoom in or out of whatever you are looking at.\nThey tend to occupy the middle level of focal length / magnification, so you may need very high and low magnification eyepieces (short and long focal lengths, respectively), but a zoom one can handle everything between you.\nTelescope Eyepiece Sets\nLenses for Telescope Sets are a great idea for anyone new to backyard astronomy. For one price, they provide a selection of eyepieces and filters to improve the versatility of your telescope setup.\nThe Eyepiece Set offers package of various eyepieces, conveniently providing a full array of different magnifications and powers in one place. This lets you find numerous eyepieces that are all compatible with your telescope.. The big three astronomy manufacturers, Celestron, Orion and Meade, produce their own eyepiece kits and we have selected the best one here in this article.\nBasic Tips to Follow When Shopping for Eyepieces\n- Consider the focal length of your telescope, or telescopes, to make sure the eyepiece will provide an appropriate magnification to suit your needs.\n- If you wear eyeglasses while using a telescope, pay attention to the eye relief specification of different eyepieces, as ample eye relief can improve comfort and ease-of-use while wearing corrective lenses.\n- Depending on your observing goals, consider the apparent field of view of your eyepiece choices.\n- If versatility is paramount, consider a zoom eyepiece or Barlow lens to increase the number of possible magnifications to use."
