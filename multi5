Prompt : 
Below you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. 
Please review the following texts carefully. 
While the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.

---Begin Context---
Document content: What is Service Learning, and Why Does it Matter?
Service learning is grouded in experiential education - learning by doing. Projects can be developed and adapted for students in Preschool, Lower, Middle and Upper School.
"Service learning allows students to apply classroom principles, concepts, and skills to projects that serve the community," said Angela Woodson
, Director of Service Learning & Community Service. "Students use critical thinking and problem-solving in new and challenging ways that, ultimately, changes their views of themselves and the world."
Through service learning, students work together with their teacher to develop community projects. Afterwards, students reflect on what happened during the experience. The learning becomes meaningful, and students see how and why their education is preparing them to become involved citizens. When students serve, they learn!

Document content: In a way, is it a rethinking of traditional educational programs?
School, unfortunately, right now, is really about tests and it’s mostly results driven.
I look at 826 as an incubator of creativity and the unbridled passion of people creating and building things, some of which you don’t really see in schools.
You get to an 826 and we are results driven. But our ‘results driven’ is about the journey of getting there and how much fun you are having along the way in creating things. There is no test at the end of anything we do.
Can you describe the importance of a hands-on approach to education?
The one‑on‑one attention and the hands‑on approach really gives students and volunteers an opportunity to take ownership over what they’ve created. Our model is rooted in project‑based learning, which really gives the kids a framework to work within. You have a start, you have a middle and then an end. When the process is over, you are left with something tangible in your hands. Afterwards, when the kids have created a book for instance, they can walk away with the finished product that they can keep forever.
What do you consider the larger goal of 826National?
I think that the larger picture is getting the young people that we work with to become engaged citizens. What real-world skills do they have and how do they interact with adults? Do they have the self‑esteem to go after a job or go into whatever field they choose, and are they prepared to present themselves in a way that’s going to be in their best interest? I look at it as the democratic process of life. You are engaged and want to be part of the world.
Please join us on November 1st to hear Gerald discuss putting the creativity back in education through engaging educational programs at PSFK CONFERENCE SAN FRANCISCO.

Document content: Importance of Field Trips in EducationSubmitted By: John Smith in Education Tips category
Field trip is a group trip for which students are taken out away from their normal environment. Normally, schools take their students to places of education and observation. This can be a museum or an old historical place. Trips provide outside world experience to the students. It also helps them have some practical knowledge. Students get a chance to observe the subject in the natural state and possibly collect some samples. Field trips also make students feel like coming to school due to the interest they feel while visiting different places when they go for a trip. Therefore, there is much importance of field trips in education.
Importance of Field Trips in Education
Field trips increase social skills of children. During trips, many of the times, children have to interact with other people and children from other schools. This helps them to develop their social activity. Trips make the children exposed to the world and they develop practical skills of dealing with things. Normally, children don’t get to meet new people other than their family and relatives. This makes them self centered and they may not know how to talk with strangers. Trips give them opportunity for public interaction. Moreover, the daily routine life of children makes them attached to the same situations that they may come across every day. It makes them confined to a boundary. If you want your child to get out of the boundaries and be a socially active person in future, you need to provide social exposure.
Theoretical knowledge through books and internet can only provide them the information, but it won’t provide them practical knowledge. Till they don’t have any practical knowledge, they won’t be able to grasp it well as well as they won’t be able to implement it in their life. As a whole we can say that theoretical knowledge can only make them feed with knowledge that is useless. Actual experience of things makes them actually know what it means and where can they apply them. Practical knowledge is something that makes children strong at their base. After they get practical exposure, they will be able to discuss it with more confidence and accuracy. Generally, there are topics and subjects which cannot be explained to children unless they have a practical experience.
Many of the parents may take their children to zoos, museums, parks etc., but some of them are not bothered about taking their kids for any travel.

--Question--
Could education succeed without experiential learning?

Instructions:
- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.
- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.

--Response Rules--
- Response should be a json with key 'answer'
Answer: Education could still succeed without experiential learning, but it might lack the practical application and engagement that experiential learning provides. Traditional methods can deliver theoretical knowledge effectively, but experiential learning offers students the chance to apply concepts in real-world situations, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deeper understanding of how their education prepares them for active citizenship. While field trips, service learning, and hands-on projects enhance learning by connecting theory with practice, a curriculum focused solely on books and tests can still impart knowledge and skills necessary for academic success.
Ground truth : Education without experiential learning would be severely limited. While traditional learning was confined to basic science experiments and holiday assignments, modern technology like VR and AI has transformed hands-on education by allowing students to have immersive experiences like exploring the Titanic wreck or watching dinosaurs. This aligns with how Design and Technology education develops children's skills through collaborative problem-solving and practical activities like investigating existing products, developing specific skills, and creating products for real purposes. Without these experiential elements, students would miss out on the engagement, creativity and stronger learning outcomes that come from 'feeling' the content rather than just learning it.

Prompt : 
Below you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. 
Please review the following texts carefully. 
While the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.

---Begin Context---
Document content: AC units and heat pumps have an average lifespan of 15 years, so choosing to upgrade to a current energy efficient model may be in your best interest if your unit is nearing that age. “How does greater energy efficiency impact me?”--The greatest impact for most homeowners or business owners is the cost for running their unit. An energy efficient unit will save money on your annual cooling and heating bills. Although models with greater efficiency can have a higher upfront cost, the long-term savings make up for the cost easily. “Do these regulations apply to both individuals and businesses?”--The new regulations apply to all new AC or heat pump systems, regardless of whether they are in an office building or home. Existing systems are not required to be replaced if they are functioning properly and installed prior to next January.“If I need to replace my system this year, should I go ahead and choose one that meets the new standard?”--Absolutely! We recommend going ahead and upgrading to a unit that meets the region’s new regulations. If you have any questions about the regulation coming in January, reach out to Comfort Air. We are standing by to help you understand your options for energy efficiency.
Replacing your HVAC system can be overwhelming. There are many elements to consider once it happens. If your system is broken when you need it most, it can add additional pressure as you determine the steps you need to take. Fortunately, you can ask questions to ensure you think about all aspects of HVAC replacement. These questions will help you adequately plan to find another HVAC system that fits your needs. Here are five questions you should ask yourself when replacing your HVAC system: What is the age of your HVAC system? According to the United States Department of Energy, the average HVAC's lifespan is 15 to 20 years. However, the lifespan could be shorter if you live in hotter climates that require the use of your heating and cooling system more than others. Therefore, understanding the age of your HVAC system can help you determine how often you should replace it. If you're approaching the higher end of that age range, it is time to start thinking about replacing your HVAC system. How large is your home? The size and layout of your home will impact the effectiveness of an HVAC system. If you have added square footage to your home, renovated an area, or plan to move to another location entirely, your HVAC needs have likely evolved.

Document content: Top 5 HVAC Maintenance Best Practices for Energy Savings
How closely are your facilities following HVACR best practices? Did you know HVAC is the largest energy end use in the non-residential sector and accounts for more than 40 percent of total energy use?
Meanwhile, the U.S. EPA estimates that the national refrigerant leak rate is 25 percent, which means that facility managers are spending 25 percent more on electricity just to keeps HVACR units running.
This accelerates maintenance spend unnecessarily.
Now, by properly maintaining your HVACR equipment, your potential for energy savings is substantial.
In fact, here are the top 5 HVAC maintenance practices that your building portfolio should adhere to:
5 HVAC Maintenance Best Practices for Energy Savings
1.) Track your assets. Have an inventory of all your HVACR equipment; know the age, condition, use, and refrigerant type of each unit. You can’t properly guide and lead your workforce without clearly identifying your cylinders, systems, and people.
2.) Track your activity. Know who is working on what and what is going where. For example, know how much refrigerant is being used and/or added to your equipment. To comply with national and state refrigerant management regulations, record every transaction, including the primary technician(s) who work(s) on a unit.
3.) Project refrigerant leak rates accurately. Answer this: What are the leak rates of your HVAC systems? 25%…? 35%…? 45%…? (Yes, most likely, at least some of your units are leaking!) Answering this question is crucial because the more a system leaks, the more money that drips out of your wallet. Not to mention, by reducing your refrigerant leaks, you can extend the longevity of your units.
4.) Conduct periodic review of systems. The frequency of these reviews depends upon the size of the systems; the following is recommended:
- Large systems (which contain 2,000 lbs of refrigerant or more) — Conduct monthly reviews.
- Medium systems (which contain 200 lbs but less than 2,000 lbs of refrigerant) — Conduct quarterly reviews.
- Smaller systems (which contain more than 50 lbs but less than 200 lbs of refrigerant) — Conduct annual reviews.
5.) Build a budget based on the equipment’s replacement value.

Document content: How Does Upgrading Your AC Unit Actually Save You Money?
When it comes to the overall cost of an air conditioning unit there are a few different things to consider. For starters, ac units can cost thousands of dollars if you are putting in a new system but it can also save you money. How can replacing your ac unit help save money? Lower Energy Bills Older units take more electricity to run in most cases due to the fact that they are not using energy smart technology. This means that your older unit may be driving up the cost of cooling your home each season because it has to work harder to cool your home. If you replace with a newer, energy smart air conditioning unit you can cut your bill up to half and save money on necessary cooling costs. Lower Maintenance Costs Another way that replacing your unit can save you money is in maintenance costs. As your unit ages, it is going to need more frequent repairs, the parts are going to become harder and harder to find, and you are likely going to have to call out a technician more often to repair it resulting in high fees. For the most part, newer units need...View Article Read More

--Question--
How much energy can modern HVAC systems save compared to older models, and what specific maintenance steps help maximize these savings?

Instructions:
- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.
- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.

--Response Rules--
- Response should be a json with key 'answer'
Answer: Modern HVAC systems can save up to 50% on energy costs compared to older models by using energy-efficient technology. To maximize these savings, specific maintenance steps include tracking assets and their condition, monitoring refrigerant usage and leaks, conducting periodic system reviews based on size, and budgeting for equipment replacement. Regular maintenance helps ensure that the system operates efficiently, reducing energy consumption and lowering maintenance costs over time.
Ground truth : Modern HVAC systems use 30-50% less energy to produce cool air compared to systems from the 1970s. To maximize these savings, regular maintenance is crucial - filters should be changed about every 12 weeks and annual technician service is recommended. Additionally, using a smart thermostat to regulate temperatures during non-office hours and ensuring correct sizing of the equipment can further enhance efficiency. Oversized HVAC units, common in older buildings, result in higher purchase costs and increased daily operating charges.

Document content: The female fishing community representation around the world could be central in delivering both successful climate action and sustainable development
The message of the project
The project resonates with stories of other marginalized communities in some way or the other.
In the world of change, marginalized women populations are exposed, and sensitive to climate change impacts due to their resource-based livelihoods and the absence of recognized rights over resources contribute to their vulnerability to economic and social structures, that are exacerbated by climate change. Despite their high exposure and sensitivity, local coastal communities are actively responding to climate change.
The project calls out the need to preserve, protect the women rights and promote the cultural heritage and knowledge. The indigenous, local, and traditional knowledge systems and practices are a significant resource for adapting to climate change.
Our society should build a system where current systems tie up traditional systems of governance and social networks reinforce the ability to respond collectively to change and develop resilience.
To develop the project, Marine scientists at Umea University, Coastal communities on Facebook, students at Umea Institute of Design were sought out.
The project began with grasping people's reaction to the climate change in the future. 25 Students from different nationalities and countries at Umea Institute of Design were given a journal to fill in, the questions directed towards putting them into hypothetical climate change scenario and how would they design their world in that situation. To my surprise, when handing over that journal back, informally participants told me they are never going to get influenced by it. That made me wonder about people who are getting affected by the climate change the most. Further, during my desktop research, I started looking into people living on the coast and reached out coastal communities through facebook. Through that, I assimilated livelihoods of the fishery communities are getting affected because of rapid climate changes. Further, I found out that women in fishing communities often are unrepresented not only in developing countries but globally. From the stage, the Project directed towards giving identity to marginalized fishery women living on the coast.
A workshop was conducted with four design students to ideate and brainstorm on how to represent the women from these communities. They were given fictional coastal newspaper as a probe related to the effect of climate changes on the coastal region. I directed the project in identifying their strengths in the changing world of marginalized fishery women community. I invested time in reaching to communities living on the coast of India and understanding the current local scenario, where the abundance of traditional knowledge which is neglected.

Document content: How Successful are Microfinance Initiatives Directed at Women in Achieving Poverty Reduction?
Late 1980s and the 1990s saw a change in development practice; there was a shift from the state-led approach to a market-led approach. It was believed that markets are not mechanisms for achieving only economic growth, but also political freedom and social justice (Rankin, 2001, p.19). In line with this argument microfinance initiatives were introduced underpinned by the assumption that the poor should be given access to the market, satisfying both the neo-liberal philosophy of the importance of the market as well as participation discourse that encourages bottom-up approach to development. Soon, a consensus was reached among scholars and development practitioners that microfinance, and especially microcredit, was a panacea for poverty world-wide (ibid.).
The aim of this essay is to evaluate the success of microfinance initiatives that are directed at women in achieving poverty reduction. It argues that while these initiatives are beneficial, the belief that they alone can reduce poverty is too simplistic. Rather than focusing on the minimalist credit-only approach as opposed to integrated “credit plus” approach to microfinance service provision (for the importance of the latter, please refer to Islam, 2006) it draws attention to the importance of measures tackling the existing social norms and economic opportunities. The essay is divided into two parts. The first part introduces the concept of microfinance and the rationale behind targeting women, which is critically examined. The second part looks at the impact of microfinance initiatives directed at women on poverty alleviation. Drawing on examples from some African and Asian countries, the argument is built on the examination of two dimensions of poverty, namely income generation and empowerment.
THE POWER OF MICROFINANCE
Financial services provided by formal institutions do not reach all segments of population. Due to constraints such as collateral, land ownership, income and high interest rates, largely the poor cannot access these services and do not have the opportunity of breaking away from the poverty circle by making use of their skills. Women face additional obstacles since lack of experience and illiteracy make it difficult for them to deal with formal credit services (Endeley and Thompson, 2005, p.8). As an answer to these problems the concept of microfinance emerged.

--Question--
How do microfinance institutions and credit groups help women in fishing communities, and what challenges do they face?

Instructions:
- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.
- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.

--Response Rules--
- Response should be a json with key 'answer'
Answer: Microfinance institutions and credit groups help women in fishing communities by providing them access to financial services, which can empower them economically and enhance their participation in decision-making processes. These initiatives can improve income generation and support poverty alleviation among women. However, challenges may include limited access due to social norms, lack of literacy, and difficulty in dealing with formal credit services, as well as the vulnerability of these communities to climate change impacts on their livelihoods.
Ground truth : Microfinance institutions and credit groups serve crucial functions for women in fishing communities, though their effectiveness varies by ownership type. Credit and savings groups (PCR) provide forums for poorer people, especially women who lack access to other credit opportunities, helping them develop financial literacy and management skills. However, women face several obstacles in accessing these services. They are underrepresented in local fisheries management committees and credit groups due to low levels of education and income. Poverty prevents women from learning about collective action benefits, while illiteracy prevents them from holding managerial positions. As a result, many women must rely on unfavorable money lending relationships with high interest rates. Studies show that non-governmental organizations and cooperatives have much lower technical efficiency than banks and non-bank financial intermediaries in providing these services in Latin America.

Document content: There is also a recognized civil conspiracy claim in Texas. An action for civil conspiracy has five elements: (1) a combination of two or more persons; (2) the persons seek to accomplish an object or course of action; (3) the persons reach a meeting of the minds on the object or course of action; (4) one or more unlawful, overt acts are taken in pursuance of the object or course of action; and (5) damages occur as a proximate result. First United Pentecostal Church of Beaumont v. Parker, 514 S.W.3d 214 (Tex. 2017).
There is not any particularly compelling guidance on whether these three claims are the same or different. And if they are different, what differences are there regarding the elements of each claim? For a great discussion of these forms of joint liability for breach of fiduciary duty, please see E. Link Beck, Joint and Several Liability, State Bar of Texas, 10th Annual Fiduciary Litigation Course (2015).
There was confusion as to whether a finding of conspiracy or aiding and abetting or knowing participation automatically imposes joint liability on all defendants for all damages. Most of the cases seem to indicate that a separate damage finding is necessary for each defendant because the conspiracy may not proximately cause the same damages as the original bad act. See THPD, Inc. v. Continental Imports, Inc., 260 S.W.3d 593 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, no pet.); Bunton v. Bentley, 176 SW.3d 1 (Tex. App.—Tyler 1999), aff’d in part, rev’d in part on other grounds, 914 S.W.3d 561 (Tex. 2002); Belz v. Belz, 667 S.W.2d 240 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.). The Texas Supreme Court held that the conspiracy defendant’s actions must cause the damages awarded against it, and a plaintiff cannot solely rely on just the original bad actor’s conduct. First United Pentecostal Church of Beaumont v. Parker, 514 S.W.3d at 214.

--Question--
How does civil conspiracy liability work in joint tortfeasor cases, and what elements must be proven for different types of conspiracy claims?

Instructions:
- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.
- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.

--Response Rules--
- Response should be a json with key 'answer'
Answer: In joint tortfeasor cases, civil conspiracy liability requires proving five elements: (1) a combination of two or more persons; (2) the persons seek to accomplish an object or course of action; (3) the persons reach a meeting of the minds on the object or course of action; (4) one or more unlawful, overt acts are taken in pursuance of the object or course of action; and (5) damages occur as a proximate result. Different types of conspiracy claims may have variations in these elements, but generally, they all require proof of the combination of persons, a common goal, an agreement, action toward the goal, and resulting damages.
Ground truth : Civil conspiracy liability requires a combination between two or more individuals or entities. There are two types: lawful means conspiracy (requiring predominant purpose to injure) and unlawful means conspiracy (requiring unlawful acts). For lawful means conspiracy, the elements are: concerted action between parties, predominant purpose to cause damage, overt acts pursuant to the agreement, and resulting damage. For unlawful means conspiracy, the elements are: concerted action, unlawful steps, knowledge of unlawfulness, intention to cause damage (not necessarily predominant), overt acts, and resulting damage. All co-conspirators are jointly and severally liable for the loss caused, even those who only reached the agreement but didn't directly cause damage. However, in Texas, courts now require separate damage findings for each defendant, as the conspiracy may not proximately cause the same damages as the original bad act. A plaintiff must establish that each conspiracy defendant caused particular damages after joining the conspiracy.

Document content: E-waste recycling process in steps
Despite the development of patents or of customized systems, e-waste recycling process can be summarized in the following steps:
Step #1 – Manual sorting
E-waste is sorted by hand at its arrival at the recycling facility. At this step batteries and cables of copper are removed for quality check. In addition, toners are removed from printers.
Step #2 – Manual dismantling
E-waste is manually dismantled. Aim of dismantling is to retrieve all the parts that compose e-waste. Then dismantled parts are categorized into core materials and components.
Further categorization includes separation of items that can be reused or should be recycled through the recycling process.
Step #3 – Size reduction process
This step consists of two phases; the primary and the secondary size reduction processes.
- Phase #1
During primary size reduction, all materials that cannot be further dismantled are shredded to pieces between four and ten inches. This process is the preparatory step for further categorization of shredded materials.
- Phase #2
Right before secondary size reduction, shredded e-waste is spread on a conveyor belt using and automated shaking process. The size of materials is further reduced to less than two inches. Any dust generated during this process is discarded in an appropriate and environmentally friendly way.
Step #4 – Overband magnet
Following size reduction, magnets remove all ferrous metals such as steel and iron.
Step #5 – Separation of metallic and nonmetallic materials
During this step metals such as copper, aluminum and brass are separated from the nonmetallic content. Recovered metal can either be reused or sold as raw materials.
Step #6 – Water separation
It is the last step of e-waste recycling process. After metal recovery, the remaining fraction consists of plastic and glass. Taking advantage of the difference in density, water is used to separate plastic from glass.
Having completed the e-waste recycling process all recovered materials such as metals (ferrous, nonferrous and valuable), plastic and glass can be sold as raw materials.

Document content: Although these products are safe while in use, they are considered hazardous waste when discarded due to their content of heavy metals, predominantly lead and mercury, and other toxic chemicals. It has been illegal in California to put E-waste into the garbage since 2006.
Free E-waste recycling options:
- Collection drives for E-waste are held throughout the community as fundraisers for many local non-profit organizations. Watch for announcements in the local media or on our Events Calendar.
- Curbside bulky item collection accepts E-waste. Contact your hauler for details.
- Drop-off E-waste at any of SVR’s Facilities.
For more information on how electronic waste is properly processed and recycled visit Onsite Electronics Recycling.

Document content: Types of e-waste
Before we walk you down the alley of how to successfully start an e-waste recycling business, we need to point out the various types of e-waste. They include:
- Damaged computer monitors
- Cathode ray tubes (CRT)
- Printed circuit boards (PCB)
- Compact disks
- Mobile phones
- Laptop and mobile phone chargers
- Plasma and Liquid crystal display (LCD) televisions
- Refrigerators and air conditioners
Methods used to recycle e-waste
A variety of methods can be employed to recycle different types of e-waste successfully. For cathode ray tubes used in ATMs, video cameras, computer monitors, and television screens, a simple process of breaking and removing the yoke can be employed. When it comes to printed circuit boards where chips and other electronic components are placed, desoldering and complete removal of the computer chips are the first things to do. Subsequently, the boards can be burned openly and bathed in acid to remove the metals present.
For gold-plated components and chips, nitric and hydrochloric acid can be used to strip them off chemically. More so, burning tends to bring the metals out of the chips. To recycle computer wires, open burning and stripping the wires will expose the copper wire for full extraction. Finally, to recycle plastic from keyboards, monitors, printers, and other electronics, shredding works efficiently. However, to recycle and reuse plastic, low temperatures can be used to melt them.
Precious metals that are present in e-waste
Just before we go into the steps needed to start an e-waste recycling business, we need to highlight major rare-earth elements and precious metals that you stand to gain massively from when you begin your journey into the e-waste recycling business. Identifying and extracting these precious metals can be a game-changer and can bring in unprecedented profits for your business. The following products can be obtained from the recycling of e-waste.
This can be gotten from electrolytic capacitors and almost every discarded electronic product that uses more than a few watts of power.
Copper is present in printed circuit board tracks and is the major element in the copper wire of electrical gadgets.
Zinc used in plating the steel parts of electronic products can be extracted through recycling.
A lot of tin can be extracted from solder and coatings on component leads.

--Question--
How are e-waste collection systems implemented?

Instructions:
- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.
- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.

--Response Rules--
- Response should be a json with key 'answer'
Answer: E-waste collection systems are implemented through various methods such as manual sorting at recycling facilities, where e-waste is initially sorted by hand, and manual dismantling to retrieve all parts that compose the e-waste. Additionally, size reduction processes are employed, including shredding and shaking to separate materials and reduce their size. Overband magnets remove ferrous metals, followed by the separation of metallic and nonmetallic materials. Finally, water separation is used to differentiate between plastic and glass in the remaining fraction.
Ground truth : E-waste collection systems are implemented through a coordinated network of authorized collection centers and logistics partners. Collection points are established across different regions, where consumers can drop off their end-of-life electronic products. The process involves strengthening knowledge of collection systems, implementing consumer behavior campaigns, and developing high-yielding collection approaches for different demographics. Collection services include door-step pickup options through authorized recyclers, with toll-free numbers for consumer support. The system requires mapping technological options for recycling, considering current dismantling processes, and implementing ICT solutions to channel e-waste to appropriate recycling facilities. This is supported by Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) strategies to enable effective local e-waste management systems.

Below you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. 
Please review the following texts carefully. 
While the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.

---Begin Context---
Document content: Technology and impact on workforce
We have already noticed changes in the workforce due to Automation and Artificial Intelligence.
Business leaders and policymakers can move forward and grow by understanding these shifts that change the fundamental nature of work.
Robert Solow argues in his publication: “A contribution to the theory of economic growth, Quarterly Journal of Economics”, that most of the increases in human living standards come from improved productivity. New technologies and new techniques of production and distribution lead to productivity growth.
So what does advanced technology promise? Higher productivity, which leads to economic growth, safety, reduced human error – as a result of efficiency, and the list can go on.
Does workforce automation result in job losses? The real value is brought by the affirmation: Jobs lost, jobs gained. Automation holds the promise of improving many jobs — and creating new, more satisfying ones. Let’s try and look at the bright side: AI and automation can reduce the workload of repetitive, tiresome tasks, allowing us to focus on the human’s part of work that we need for our brains to work more effectively and creatively.
What do statistics say when it comes to existing work tasks? Let’s take a look at the data below, based on a report that covers 12 industries.
We see a decrease in the number of hours performed by humans during this period of time: 2018 – 2022. This is when machines replace an additional 13% of the human work.
Ravin Jesuthasan and John Boudreau argue in an article from SHRM.org that we should: “Start with the work, not the “job” or the technology. Much work will continue to exist as traditional “jobs” in organizations, but automation makes traditional jobs more fluid and an increasing amount of work will occur outside the traditional boundaries of a “job.”

Document content: By investing in Internet and communication technology policies, governments and societies can expand access to information and enable new business models.
Similarly, research and development policies are essential for spurring innovation and creating new technologies and products. These policies include investments in research and development in areas such as healthcare, agriculture, and energy. By investing in research and development policies, governments and societies can create new jobs and improve overall economic competitiveness.
Importance of Infrastructure and Technology Policies in Politics and Society
Infrastructure and technology policies impact politics and society in numerous ways. By investing in these policies, governments and societies can create jobs, stimulate economic growth, and improve the overall quality of life. For example, transportation infrastructure policies can improve access to jobs and education, while research and development policies can create new jobs and technologies.
It’s crucial to balance investments in infrastructure and technology policies to ensure sustainable economic growth and societal progress. Governments and societies need to prioritize these policies and invest in them for long-term benefits.

Document content: It also will help in upgrading traditional industries such as through smart manufacturing and connected farming.

Answer: Infrastructure investments and robotics play a crucial role in transforming traditional human-dependent sectors like transportation and farming by upgrading these industries through smart manufacturing and connected farming. This transformation leads to increased efficiency, reduced human error, and the potential for creating new jobs and more satisfying work opportunities as automation reduces repetitive and tiresome tasks, allowing humans to focus on creative and brain-engaging aspects of work.
Ground truth : Infrastructure investments and robotics are revolutionizing both sectors. In transportation, Los Angeles is investing in new transit systems through Measure R, which funds subway expansion, light rail, and rapid-bus lines, while also encouraging transit-oriented development and reducing parking requirements. In agriculture, there's massive investment in robotics, with the market expected to grow from $3.0 billion in 2015 to $73.9 billion by 2024. This includes innovations like autonomous tractors, the Lely Astronaut A4 milking system with over 20,000 units worldwide, and specialized robots for tasks like strawberry picking, grape pruning, and lettuce thinning. These changes are designed to address labor shortages and increase efficiency in both sectors.

---Begin Context---
Document content: The great Saturn ring debate is far from settled, a new study suggests.
For years, scientists have argued about the age of Saturn's famous rings: Are they ancient, dating to the birth of the planet itself? Or did the ring system form more recently, in just the past hundred million years or so?
This latter hypothesis has been gaining steam in the last few years, with multiple papers reporting that the rings could be even younger than the dinosaurs. Such studies cite the rings' composition — more than 95% pure water ice — and total mass, which NASA's Cassini mission pegged at about 15.4 million billion metric tons shortly after the probe's epic "grand finale" at Saturn in 2017. (For perspective, 15.4 million billion metric tons is about 40% the mass of the Saturn moon Mimas, which is 250 miles, or 400 kilometers, wide.)

Given these two figures, and the bombardment rate by micrometeoroids, the rings must be young, the idea goes. After all, old rings should be much more "polluted" with silicates, organic molecules and other compounds.
But there are some serious issues with this interpretation, argues the new study, which was led by Aurélien Crida of the Université Côte d'Azur and the Institut Universitaire de France. For starters, the scientists said, the bombardment rate may vary over time. Maybe it's unusually high right now — due to a (hypothetical) recent collision of distant Kuiper Belt objects, for example — and the rings were polluted much less intensely for most of their history.
Crida and his colleagues also note that, during the grand finale, Cassini spotted organics in Saturn's upper atmosphere as well as solid grains in the gap between the gas giant and its innermost ring. This stuff is almost certainly coming from the rings, the researchers said.
"One possible explanation is that the (unknown) process responsible for the erosion of the rings and the launch of these nanograins is actually 'cleaning' the rings, preferentially removing silicates rather than water ice," Crida and his team wrote in the new study, which was published online today (Sept. 16) in the journal Nature Astronomy.
If that's the case, the rings would appear to be much younger than they actually are.
Then there's the ring system's total mass.

Document content: But the innermost rings are fairly contaminated, as it turns out, with organic material caught up in ice.”
A further new finding from Cassini’s mass spectrometer showed large amounts of the chemical brew from Saturn’s D ring is flung into the planet’s upper atmosphere by the ring spinning faster than the planet’s atmosphere itself.
“We saw it was happening even though it’s not fully understood,” the KU researcher said. “What we saw is this material, including some benzine, was altering the uppermost atmosphere of Saturn in the equatorial region. There were both grains and dust that were contaminated.”
Cravens said the findings could cast new light on mechanisms underpinning our solar system as well as other solar systems and exoplanets — and also prompt a host of new scientific questions.
“This could help us understand, how does a planet get rings? Some do, some don’t,” he said. “What’s the lifetime of a ring? And what’s replenishing the rings? Was there a time when Saturn didn’t have rings? How did that composition get into there in the first place? Is it left over from the formation of our solar system? Does it date back to proto pre-solar nebula, the nebula that collapsed out of interstellar media that formed the sun and planets?”
According to Cravens, the higher-than-expected rate of material being expelled from Saturn’s D Ring into the planet’s upper atmosphere, or ionosphere, is sufficient that astronomers now think the lifespan of the ring may be briefer than previously estimated.
“Because of this data, we now have shortened the lifetime of inner rings because of the quantity of material being moved out — it’s much more than we thought before,” Cravens said. “We know that it’s bumping material out of the rings at least 10 times faster than we thought. If it’s not being replenished, the rings aren’t going to last — you’ve got a hole in your bucket. Jupiter probably had a ring that evolved into the current wispy ring, and it could be for similar reasons. Rings do come and go. At some point, they gradually drain away unless somehow they’re getting new material.”
Assisted by KU graduate and undergraduate students, the first stage of Cravens’ work involved sorting and cleaning raw data from Cassini’s INMS instrument.

--Question--
What has been discovered about the changing chemical composition of Saturn's rings over time, and how does this affect our understanding of their age?

Instructions:
- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.
- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.

--Response Rules--
- Response should be a json with key 'answer'
Answer: Recent studies suggest that Saturn's rings may be younger than previously thought, dating to less than the past hundred million years. The rings are composed of more than 95% pure water ice, which, given their total mass and bombardment rate by micrometeoroids, would indicate they must be relatively young. However, some scientists argue that the bombardment rate may vary over time and that there could be processes cleaning the rings, preferentially removing silicates rather than water ice, which would mean the rings might actually be older than currently estimated. The innermost rings, however, are found to be contaminated with organic material, complicating our understanding of their age and composition.
Ground truth : Initially scientists thought Saturn's rings were over 95% pure water ice, but recent findings have revealed they are far more chemically complex. The rings contain water, methane, ammonia, carbon monoxide, molecular nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. This chemical composition has been central to the debate about the rings' age. Some argue that the rings must be young (around 100 million years old) because old rings should be more polluted with silicates and organic molecules. However, there may be an unknown process that preferentially removes silicates rather than water ice, making the rings appear younger than they actually are. Additionally, the rings' current mass of 15.4 million billion metric tons is consistent with them being primordial (4.5 billion years old) and gradually evolving through spreading and moon formation.

Prompt : 
Below you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. 
Please review the following texts carefully. 
While the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.

---Begin Context---
Document content: The documentary artistry that Devor and Kirchheimer display are part of a great modern tradition—of a revolutionary practice that proved instantly inspiring—and that tradition is on display at Film Forum in a pair of series that start soon: “ ’60s Verité,” which begins on Friday and runs through February 6th, and the films of Jean Rouch (Sundays from January 21st through February 5th). Rouch’s 1960 documentary “Chronicle of a Summer” (screening this Sunday) was co-directed with the sociologist Edgar Morin, who coined the term “cinéma-vérité” to describe Rouch’s earlier films and, above all, to describe a method in which “a filmmaker-cum-deep-sea-diver plunges into a real milieu.” In “Chronicle,” Rouch and Morin went one better: they dove into French society—into the private lives and political frustrations of strangers and friends—without a protective suit, rendering themselves as vulnerable as the people they were interrogating, making themselves onscreen participants in their own investigations, revealing their own practices and concerns along with those of the participants they filmed. In the process, they veered from filming external reality into filming the imagination at work. They veered from documentary into fiction.
Cinéma-vérité, in short, is a cinema not of mere observation but of immersive engagement. It fuses investigation with self-revelation, presence with performance—and, above all, it turns its participants into self-aware performers, both behind and in front of the camera. The Film Forum series displays the first wave of cinéma-vérité in its vast variety of formats, from documentaries that, today, look utterly classical, such as the founding American film of the genre, Robert Drew’s “Primary,” or D. A. Pennebaker’s “Don’t Look Back,” Peter Lennon’s “Rocky Road to Dublin,” or Frederick Wiseman’s “Hospital”; others, such as Shirley Clarke’s “Portrait of Jason” or even Drew’s film “The Chair,” from 1962, retain their radical force of their self-aware and self-revealing performances.

Document content: In terms of people, good framing might avoid cutting parts off, such as their heads or feet. But framing also offers the opportunity for commentary on the subject and even on the idea of documentary interviews.
Trinh T. Minh-ha, for example, combines framing with camera movement during the interviews in Surname Viet Given Name Nam (1989). Instead of centering the speaker from the waist or chest up within the frame, Trinh migrates the camera around the subject, moving in for extreme close-ups on hands and eyes while the person continues talking. Instead of focusing on the face while a person talks, the camera might remain on a person’s hands. The overall effect is unsettling, but that is part of Trinh’s point with not only this piece, but also some of her other works, particularly Reassemblage (1982).
A more traditional example comes from Pare Lorentz’s classic The River (1938) with the simple framing of these two children, with one looking right at the camera and one looking away:
Also consider this silhouette from the same film:
Both of these images convey strong emotions through their choices of subject, their forms of framing, and even the choice of lighting, particularly in the second shot.
The River makes for a nice segue to talk about landscapes. The framing of landscapes conveys so many different meanings. In Lorentz’s film, for example, the Mighty Mississippi ignores its banks and wanders where it chooses:
The more recent documentary Sweetgrass (POV 2011) also offers some compelling shots of the Montana mountains alongside the challenges of sheep herding:
The BBC’s Planet Earth documentary really shows how framing and landscape work together. Granted, those makers had a beautiful subject to start with, but they still emphasized that beauty throughout the entire piece:
Not all landscapes are visually beautiful, but the framing still helps show us what we need to see. Consider this shot from Haskell Wexler’s hybrid drama-vérité film Medium Cool (1969), which uses the car door as a frame within a frame to show the city of Chicago:
The framing reminds us of the urban grittiness of the city, and it also connects to the tensions that underlie Wexler’s complex piece.
Framing further reveals objects. It can reinforce the everyday as the everyday, or it can make the everyday seem extraordinary.

Document content: Gordon Parks’ ethically complex depictions of crime in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles, with previously unseen photographs.
When Life magazine asked Gordon Parks to illustrate a recurring series of articles on crime in the United States in 1957, he had already been a staff photographer for nearly a decade, the first African American to hold this position. Parks embarked on a six-week journey that took him and a reporter to the streets of New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Unlike much of his prior work, the images made were in color. The resulting eight-page photo-essay “The Atmosphere of Crime” was noteworthy not only for its bold aesthetic sophistication, but also for how it challenged stereotypes about criminality then pervasive in the mainstream media. They provided a richly hued, cinematic portrayal of a largely hidden world: that of violence, police work and incarceration, seen with empathy and candor.
Parks rejected clichés of delinquency, drug use and corruption, opting for a more nuanced view that reflected the social and economic factors tied to criminal behavior and afforded a rare window into the working lives of those charged with preventing and prosecuting it. Transcending the romanticism of the gangster film, the suspense of the crime caper and the racially biased depictions of criminality then prevalent in American popular culture, Parks coaxed his camera to record reality so vividly and compellingly that it would allow Life’s readers to see the complexity of these chronically oversimplified situations. The Atmosphere of Crime, 1957 includes an expansive selection of never-before-published photographs from Parks’ original reportage.
In February, MoMA acquired 56 prints from The Atmosphere of Crime series. The Museum and The Gordon Parks Foundation collaborated closely on the selection of 55 modern color prints and the Foundation has also gave the Museum a rare vintage gelatin silver print (a companion to a print Parks himself gave the Museum in 1993).
Gordon Parks was born into poverty and segregation in Fort Scott, Kansas, in 1912. An itinerant laborer, he worked as a brothel pianist and railcar porter, among other jobs, before buying a camera at a pawnshop, training himself and becoming a photographer. He evolved into a modern-day Renaissance man, finding success as a film director, writer and composer.

--Question--
What are the key differences between how traditional documentary photographers like Gordon Parks approached their work versus how modern film documentarians like Trinh T. Minh-ha frame their subjects?

Instructions:
- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.
- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.

--Response Rules--
- Response should be a json with key 'answer'
Answer: Traditional documentary photographers like Gordon Parks approached their work with a focus on capturing reality and empathy, often challenging stereotypes and providing nuanced views of social issues. In contrast, modern film documentarians like Trinh T. Minh-ha frame their subjects in a more experimental and deconstructive manner, using techniques that emphasize the constructed nature of reality and encourage viewers to question and reflect on the narratives presented.
Ground truth : Traditional documentary photographers like Gordon Parks, Dorothea Lange, and Walker Evans used photography as a tool for activism, investigating and exposing inequality and injustice. In contrast, modern film documentarians like Trinh T. Minh-ha take a more artistic approach, using unconventional framing techniques. For instance, in Surname Viet Given Name Nam, Trinh migrates the camera around the subject and focuses on extreme close-ups of hands and eyes during interviews, creating an unsettling effect rather than pursuing a direct activist agenda.

Prompt : 
Below you will find several documents that provide context for answering the upcoming question. 
Please review the following texts carefully. 
While the context may include extraneous information, concentrate on details that are directly relevant to the question.

---Begin Context---
Document content: 9.� the reflector is parabolic.� it is completely determined by the rim coordinates (x0, y0).� to obtain its equation, first calculate slope kn of the nominal reflection, and slope k of the reflecting surface, both at the rim:
the coefficients, including the focal length f, are:
equation of the parabola is:
geometrically, a properly aligned parabolic reflector is 100% efficient.� incident sunlight strikes the cookware either directly, or through one reflection.�
a non-parabolic reflector
unless the cookware is spherical, a reflector optimized for robustness is not parabolic.�� this was clearly stated early with reference to a pan, and is true for a pot as well.� unfortunately the optimal reflector shape depends on shape, size, and orientation of the cookware.� it also depends on the direction of solar movement.� therefore it is difficult to design a truly optimal reflector for a versatile solar cooker.
fortunately an optimal reflector does not differ significantly from a parabola.� as a concrete example, consider a pot located axisymmetrically with respect to the optical axes.� two optimal reflectors and two parabolic reflectors are shown in fig. 10. their differences are small indeed.� furthermore, angular tolerance of a reflector increases toward the optical axis.� the benefit of optimizing the reflector shape, hence improving robustness in the interior of the reflector, is not overwhelming.
therefore a parabolic reflector is often adopted for ordinary cookware.� an exception occurs when the reflector is homemade out of a flat sheet .� in this case maximizing the angular tolerance is important, even in the interior of the reflector.
fig. 10�� optimal and parabolic reflectors for a pot axisymmetric to the optical axes
optimization of the rim shape
the optimal rim shape depends on the criterion chosen.� to maximize the robustness against manufacturing tolerance and solar movement, the rim should exhibit substantially equal angular tolerance.�� in most designs the reflector is a portion of an axisymmetric surface, while the pot is not axisymmetric with respect to the same axis.� therefore the optimal rim shape will be neither axisymmetric nor planar.� it depends on size, shape, and orientation of the cookware, as well as the elevation and movement of the sun.� in practice the reflector and its rim shape are optimized for a �typical� operating condition.

Document content: Solar panel tilt angle and orientation are two of the most important factors in determining how much electricity your solar panel array will generate. If you live in Australia and have a grid-connected solar system, your solar panels will be installed at the angle and aspect of your roof. In most cases – provided you have an unshaded, north or west-facing roof that is has some incline – this is the most economical approach, and your solar power yield will not be significantly less than if the panels were installed at the ‘perfect’ angle and orientation. But what should you do if you have a flat roof? Is it ever worth it to have your solar panels installed horizontally?
To tilt or not to tilt: Solar panels on a flat roof
Installing your solar panels at the ideal tilt angle and orientation for your latitude ensures that your system generates as much electricity as possible for your location. The ideal orientation for a solar panel array is due north, and the ideal tilt angle is the angle of your latitude (e.g. about 30 degrees in Sydney and Perth). Small variations away from these ideals will not result in a significant difference in the power output of your solar energy system, which is why the natural tilt angle of your roof is usually fine (and keeping that tilt frames can add significantly to the cost of your system, putting a damper on the value of the solar power it produces).
Solar panels installed on a nearly flat roof at Downfields Engineering in Toowoomba.
Solar panels installed horizontally on a roof at the St George Hotel in St George, QLD.
In the past, panel manufacturers would not offer warranties on panels installed at an angle lower than 2 degrees, but these days most of the top manufacturers will give warranties even if their panels are installed at 0 degrees (completely flat).
However, industry best practice in Australia is to ensure that panels are at least slightly tilted – so that the panels can better ‘self clean’ when it rains. It’s also worth noting that many roofs naturally have some degree of tilt – aluminium roofs, for example, usually have a pitch of about 3-4 degrees. Concrete or membrane roofs are the most common roofs that are truly horizontal – in which cases a tilt or ballast system is frequently used to give the panels at least a 10-degree pitch.
If the roof is truly flat, there are a limited number of situations in which installing your panels horizontally (or nearly horizontally) might be worth it for you.

--Question--
What geometric principles govern the design of solar panel arrays, considering both parallelogram properties and optimal tilt angles?

Instructions:
- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.
- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.

--Response Rules--
- Response should be a json with key 'answer'
Answer: The design of solar panel arrays is governed by geometric principles that prioritize maximizing sunlight capture, similar to the parabolic shape in reflectors which ensures efficient sunlight concentration. Solar panels are typically installed at an angle that matches the latitude of their location, akin to the optimal tilt angle for maximizing energy harvest, although slight variations from this ideal do not significantly impact performance. Parabolic reflectors and solar panels both benefit from considering the direction of solar movement and the orientation to optimize energy capture, demonstrating how geometric properties influence the efficiency of solar technologies.
Ground truth : Solar panel arrays combine geometric and astronomical principles for optimal design. The panels are often arranged in parallelogram formations, which have specific geometric properties - opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, and diagonals bisect each other. For maximum efficiency, the tilt angle of these arrays must be carefully considered. The optimal tilt angle should match the installation location's latitude for year-round production, with adjustments of minus 10-15 degrees in summer and plus 10-15 degrees in winter. For example, in San Diego at 32°N latitude, the base angle would be 32°, adjusting to 22° in summer and 42° in winter.

Document content: Chronic Sleep Deprivation: How it Affects Your Health
Chronic sleep deprivation is defined as getting less than the recommended seven or eight hours of sleep each night for an extended period of time. It isn’t just associated with new parents trying to survive that first year with a baby; anyone getting less than the necessary sleep on a regular basis is suffering from chronic sleep deprivation. Between all of our to-do’s, stress, lifestyle choices, and sleep disorders, this is a common problem to fall into. For some it just seems like a way of life and you may even feel like it’s not a big deal. You’re coping and still working your way through each day. But did you know that chronic sleep deprivation can wreak havoc on your body, often in ways you may not even realize are connected.
When you sleep, pathways form between nerve cells in your brain that help you remember new information you’ve learned. When you’re dealing with chronic sleep deprivation, your brain is exhausted and can’t perform its normal duties as well. This means that not only is your concentration and cognitive function affected while you’re awake, but your ability to learn new things by forming those new neural connections and creating new memories while you sleep, is also undermined.
When you’re sleep deprived, it can also affect your mood, decision-making ability, and overall mental health. If chronic sleep deprivation persists long enough, you can begin experiencing a short temper, extreme irritability, impulsive behavior, anxiety, depression, paranoia, and even hallucinations and suicidal thoughts.
When you sleep, your body produces cytokines, protective and infection fighting proteins. These proteins give your immune system a boost, providing reinforcements to defend the body from all kinds of viruses and bacteria. If you’re experiencing chronic sleep deprivation, your body isn’t able to build up its protection and fend off potential invaders. Long-term sleep deprivation can cause a lowered immune system, or an overactive one, leading to symptoms associated with some autoimmune conditions.
Finally, chronic sleep deprivation also seems to affect your waistline as well. What does sleep and weight have to do with another you ask? Well, sleep affects leptin and ghrelin which control feelings of hunger and being full. Leptin is in charge of telling your brain you’ve had enough to eat and ghrelin is an appetite stimulant. When you’re not getting enough sleep, leptin is reduced and ghrelin is raised.

--Question--
What happens to our body when we don't get enough sleep during pregnancy, and how does it affect overall health outcomes?

Instructions:
- Provide a short paragraph directly answering the question.
- Ignore any parts of the context that are not pertinent to the question.

--Response Rules--
- Response should be a json with key 'answer'
Answer: During pregnancy, sleep is crucial for both maternal and fetal health. Lack of sufficient sleep can affect overall health outcomes by increasing the risk of sleep-disordered breathing, restless leg syndrome, and postpartum sleep disturbances. Sleep deprivation in pregnant women may also lead to complications such as gestational diabetes and hypertension. Moreover, poor sleep quality can impact the mother's mental health, leading to mood disorders and stress. Therefore, ensuring adequate and restful sleep during pregnancy is essential for optimal health outcomes for both the mother and the developing fetus.
Ground truth : Insufficient sleep during pregnancy has several serious consequences. Women who sleep less than 6 hours at night experience longer labors and are 4.5 times more likely to have cesarean deliveries. Getting less than five hours of sleep per night in the first trimester makes women nearly 10 times more likely to develop preeclampsia in late pregnancy. Additionally, inadequate sleep is associated with overeating, obesity, elevated cholesterol, increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, and death from all causes. Sleep deprivation also impairs the immune system's function, potentially reducing its ability to eliminate small, newly established tumors, and disrupts the production of melatonin, which is an antioxidant and inhibitor of cancer cell growth.
